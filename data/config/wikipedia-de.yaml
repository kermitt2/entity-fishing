# Above this frequency, the more frequent terms will be skipped and not disambiguated. 
# The goal is to speed-up processing by ignoring very frequent word which are likely 
# fonctional and common words not realizing an entity or not realizing an entity of 
# interest. The frequency is expressed as zipf, i.e. a number typically between 0 and 8:
# - a term with zipf value 6 appears once per thousand words
# - a term with Zipf value 3 appears once per million words
