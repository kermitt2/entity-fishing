# Above this frequency, the more frequent terms will be skipped and not disambiguated. 
# The goal is to speed-up processing by ignoring very frequent word which are likely 
# fonctional and common words not realizing an entity or not realizing an entity of 
# interest. The frequency is expressed as zipf, i.e. a number typically between 0 and 8:
# - a term with zipf value 6 appears once per thousand words
# - a term with Zipf value 3 appears once per million words

# You normally do not have to change this settings, which is optimized for the given language.
# Retraining the ranking and selector models is required if you change any of these settings.

# Possible values for the ranker decision model: 
# - BASELINE (only use conditional prob)
# - MILNE_WITTEN (Milne and Witten features)
# - MILNE_WITTEN_RELATEDNESS (only Milne and Witten relatedness measure)
# - SIMPLE (basic features in addition to Milne & Witten relatedness)
# - EMBEDDINGS (only word+entity embeddings similarity)
# - NERD (DEFAULT, basic features plus Milne&Witten and word+entity embeddings)

# Possible values for the selector decision model:  
# - BASELINE (only use conditional prob)
# - SIMPLE (basic features in addition to Milne & Witten relatedness)
# - MINIMAL (use ranking score without relatedness and basic feature)
# - NERD (DEFAULT, use ranking score with relatedness and basic feature)
