 Chakravarty declined a top government award in 1990, saying no journalist should be identified with the governing establishment. 

 He graduated from  Calcutta University   and studied at  Oxford University's Merton College   in England. 

 Chakravarty taught history at Calcutta University in the 1930s before taking to  journalism   as correspondent of a weekly brought out by the  Communist Party of India  . 

 He later joined the CPI and remained a member until 1978. 

 He closed the Mainstream weekly for a while when Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi  imposed emergency rule in India 1975-77, jailing political opponents and imposing censorship on newspapers and magazines. 

 Chakravarty was born November 3, 1913, in India's northeastern state of Assam.
