    Swiss   government eyes shutting down nuclear power plants

 The Swiss government Thursday announced that it is planning the country's eventual exit from  nuclear power  , saying it wants to support instead  hydroelectric plants  . 

 But  environmental campaigners   criticized the lack of a timeframe for closing the country's  four nuclear power plants  . 

 Government officials will work with representatives of the  power industry  , environmental groups and local governments to discuss a timetable and removal of  nuclear waste  , a government statement said. It is unrealistic to build more  power stations   because of environmental concerns, the government has said. 

 Should the discussions between concerned parties fail to produce an agreed timetable, the federal  cabinet   will make the decision, said the statement. 

 "We have set out on a new course,'' said Federal Energy Minister  Moritz Leuenberger  . "Details have yet to be decided.'' 

 In a related move, the federal cabinet ordered energy officials to draw up a discussion paper on changing laws governing the domestic  electricity   market. 

 The government envisages the creation of a national company to own the power  infrastructure  . 

 A timeframe for carrying out  liberalization   of the electricity market itself remains to be determined, the cabinet said. 

 The cabinet said it wants to support hydroelectric plants. It ordered a study of the possibility of  tax breaks  for hydroelectric plants and how to encourage upgrades of those plants.
