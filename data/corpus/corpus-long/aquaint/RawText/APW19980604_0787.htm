  Viravaidya  's plan to set up a watchdog company to monitor  SET  -listed companies and expose possible abuses of  corporate ethics  . I agree with him whole-heartedly and would like to know where to mail my checks to subscribe to the company's shares. Could you advise? 

 Also, I fully support his request for the media to report on the  lifestyle   of former  executives   of the failed  banks   and  finance   companies. We all know too well that these people will not be punished legally because of the inefficiency of the  Bank of Thailand   in collecting evidence against them and of our  justice system   in delivering timely justice. It is the media's job to discover how these guys are better off after destroying our country, and it is the  Thai people  's job to socially punish them. 

 I would like to propose that  newspapers   and  TV stations  play up this issue (the continued luxurious lifestyle of the former executives) to attract more public attention, and I will give them Bt20,000 of my hard-earned salary with my full blessing. 

 Artit Krichphiphat (An ordinary Thai citizen who wants to see the right things get done) Editor's note: Khun Mechai will organise a seminar on the plan on June 7 at the Telephone Organisation of Thailand at 10 am. The media already has the duty to cover such issues without additional financial reward.
