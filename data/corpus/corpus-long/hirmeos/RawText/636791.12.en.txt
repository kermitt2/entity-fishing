Chapter three of Objective Knowledge is called "Epistemology Without a Knowing Subject". Despite the title, Popper does not altogether neglect the personal dimension of the search for knowledge. What he does argue is that subjective knowledge is irrelevant to the study of scientific knowledge, only knowledge construed in objective, impersonal, world 3 terms being important. But this downplays the point that all of objective knowledge, stored in books and libraries, is of value only in so far as it is understood and used by people. Albert Einstein once remarked: "Knowledge exists in two forms-lifeless, stored in books, and alive in the consciousness of men. The second form of existence is after all the essential one; the first, indispensable as it may be, occupies only an inferior position"). Einstein's priorities seem saner than later Popper's. And altogether saner, more humane and downto-earth than elderly Popper's spooky world 3 objects, is the viewpoint of the more youthful Popper of O.S.E., which sees science and reason in personal, social and institutional terms, without any appeal being made to ghostly, quasi-Platonic Forms.

In 1974 Popper became the fourteenth subject of The Library of Living Philosophers, edited by P. A. Schilpp. This two-volume work opens with Popper's "Intellectual Autobiography"-subsequently published independently as Unended Quest (1976a)-continues with descriptive and critical papers on diverse aspects of Popper's work, by Quine, Putnam, Lakatos, Medawar, Watkins, Ayer, Margenau, Gr√ºnbaum, Kuhn and others, and concludes with Popper's replies. Unended Quest is a fascinating book, and gives a gripping account of Popper's lifelong, passionate engagement with his fundamental problems and concerns. It includes a marvellous discussion of the development of polyphonic music, and provides an account of Popper's battles with subjectivism in physics in connection with quantum theory, and with thermodynamics and the arrow of time. Popper also declares that it was he who killed logical positivism. This book, together with C.R., provides the best introduction to Popper's philosophy.

In 1982-3 there appeared The Postscript to The Logic of Scientific Discovery, a three-volume work which extends and elaborates doctrines and arguments of L.Sc.D., and much of which was written in the years 1951-6. The work reached the stage of proofs in 1956-7, but was abandoned because Popper suffered from detached retinas and had operations on both eyes, his sight for a time in question. It was only much later, under the editorship of W. W. Bartley III, and after some additions and rewriting, that the work finally appeared.

Volume one, entitled Realism and the Aim of, restates and elaborates Popper's earlier views and arguments concerning induction, falsification, corroboration, demarcation, realism, metaphysics and probability. At one point Popper illuminatingly contrasts how a scientific paper might be written in the style of inductivism, and in the critical, problem-solving approach of falsificationism and critical rationalism (see pp. 47-51).

Volume two, entitled The Open Universe: An Argument for Indeterminism (1982a), sets out to refute determinism. Popper distinguishes between "scientific" and metaphysical determinism. "Scientific" determinism asserts that future states of physical systems can be predicted with any degree of precision by means of theories and initial conditions specified with sufficient precision (see p. 36). Metaphysical determinism asserts merely that "all events in this world are fixed, or unalterable, or predetermined" (p. 8). Popper spells out an argument which, he claims, refutes scientific determinism. Even given a universe in which all events occur in accordance with a deterministic physical theory, T, nevertheless a predictor, put within an isolated system, could not predict all future states of the system with unlimited precision. Even if such a predictor had unprecedented powers to acquire knowledge of initial conditions, and make predictions using T, nevertheless it could not acquire up-to-date information about its own state, because the attempt to do so would continually alter its state. This means it would not be possible for the predictor to predict future states of the system of which it forms a part. Popper goes on to argue against metaphysical determinism.

Although full of interesting points, there are two oddities about this discussion. First, as Popper admits, his refutation of "scientific" determinism does not refute a second version of "scientific" determinism which asserts that past states of physical systems can be predicted, employing prior initial conditions and physical theory. Second, Popper ignores a rather different third version of "scientific" determinism, which asserts that the universe is such that there is a discoverable, true, physical "theory of everything", T, which is deterministic. This version of determinism deserves to be called "scientific", because T is asserted by it to be scientifically discoverable; furthermore, once discovered, T will be falsifiable, and hence, by Popper's own standards, scientific. It is curious that Popper, who is elsewhere (as we have seen) opposed to instrumentalism and in favour of realism, should here discuss at length a version of "scientific" determinism which is thoroughly instrumentalistic in character, in that it makes assertions about predictability, and should ignore a version of "scientific" determinism which is much more in keeping with scientific realism, in that it makes an assertion about the nature of the universe. This oversight seriously weakens Popper's argument for indeterminism.
