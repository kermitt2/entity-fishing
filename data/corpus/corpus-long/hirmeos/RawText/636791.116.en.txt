Time passes; agriculture is invented; societies become bigger, more complex, specialized and diversified, requiring much more elaborate, fixed organization. Inter-tribal trade develops; tribes coalesce. Modern methods of travel, transport and communication develop. As a result, our tribe has become the whole human world, humanity, even, perhaps, life on earth in general.

As a result of these historical developments, the task of assuming some personal responsibility for our common human world has been transformed utterly, and has become almost inconceivably more difficult. Our task is not only to take on some responsibility for the welfare of those who are known intimately to us; rather, in addition, our task is to assume some responsibility-at least to some extent-for the welfare of millions upon millions of complete strangers. No doubt our own welfare is closely bound up with the lives, actions and welfare of many of these millions of strangers through international relationships such as trade; such relationships of mutual interdependence are, however, remote, abstract, not experienced daily on a personal basis. We cannot conceivably experience direct, emotional ties with these millions upon millions of strangers as we do with our friends and members of our own family. Millions of our fellow human beings live lives, see the world and have values in many ways very different from our own. Not only does this create barriers to mutual sympathy and understanding; responsible concern to understand others, to enter into their different worlds, must inevitably lead us to question the basic assumptions, practices and values of our own world. The immense diversity of ways of life, cultures, social systems, views of the world and systems of values with which we are confronted in considering our common human life on this planet must inevitably, at some level, plunge us into doubt and indecisiveness about how to live, what to choose, what to believe and value. And finally, when put into the context of the whole human world, our own life and actions must inevitably, and quite properly, seem to shrink almost to a vanishing point. Unless we possess quite exceptional personal power or influence-something that is perhaps inherently undesirable-all that we do with our lives will have almost no kind of impact or effect whatsoever on the human world as a whole. From this standpoint we are, individually, insignificant and impotent-which may not exactly encourage us to conceive of our world and ourselves from such a standpoint.

For all these reasons it is extraordinarily difficult for the individual today to assume some personal responsibility for our common world. In earlier times this failure did not perhaps matter so much since our power to bring about worldwide changes was strictly limited. Quite suddenly, however, we have developed the capacity to make drastic changes to our whole world. As a result, our common evasion of responsibility has become extremely dangerous for us all. Disasters result. War, starvation of millions, immense imbalances of wealth and power on a worldwide basis, the population explosion, reckless squandering of irreplaceable natural resources, international politics conducted like gang warfare, the widespread existence of brutal dictatorships, criminal psychopaths (like Hitler, Papa Doc, Amin and Assad) even seizing and holding power, the worldwide accumulation of armaments, the constant threat of the nuclear holocaust, and above all global warming-all these familiar worldwide dangers and disasters are the direct outcome of our general failure to assume personal, adult responsibility for our world.

The members of a small tribal society can, without great difficulty, confront and tackle common problems of the tribe, in a cooperative, responsible fashion. Tribal meetings can be convened at which everybody can be free to articulate problems, and propose and criticize possible solutions.

In our modern world this cannot be done. The population of the earth cannot hold a meeting to discuss common problems where everyone is free to speak. And yet something like this must exist if general understanding of, and responsibility towards, our common human problems is to develop at the personal level-something that we must develop if we are to be able to cope with the dangers and disasters just indicated. We cannot rely on existing institutions, existing centres of power, existing governments, whether democratic or dictatorial: all this is all too blatantly failing at present to cope adequately, that is, humanely and rationally, with our problems. In the end the point is very simple. In the absence of general understanding of, and responsibility towards, our problems, genuinely democratic governments responsive to public opinion will be unable to act responsibly as far as our most urgent, general, common problems are concerned.Public opinion will not permit it. In a sense, only undemocratic, dictatorial governments, capable of suppressing or ignoring public opinion, will be able to act in such a fashion. Dictatorships, however, put us at the mercy of the decisions and actions of those few individuals who have won the fight for power (thus being, almost inevitably, ruthless and power-mad). Either way it is most unlikely that global problems will be tackled responsibly. For this we need a widespread, even worldwide understanding of, and responsible attitude towards, our basic problems at the personal level. And for this in turn it is essential that we develop a modern, worldwide institutional equivalent of the tribal meeting.
