Failure to fit scientific practice in detail does not, however, provide decisive grounds for rejecting a normative account of scientific method. One can always reply that the account specifies how science ought to proceed, not how it has in fact proceeded. Much more serious are the objections of principle to Kuhn's account. Kuhn, like Popper, provides no account of the creation of new paradigms. And given Kuhn's insistence that a new paradigm, after a successful revolution, is incommensurable with its pre-revolutionary predecessor, it would seem impossible to provide rational (if fallible) procedures for the creation of good new paradigms while maintaining consistency with the rest of Kuhn's views. Kuhn does allow that non-empirical criteria, or values, such as consistency and simplicity, are employed by science permanently (and therefore, presumably, across revolutions) to assess theories or paradigms; but Kuhn also emphasizes that these criteria are flexible and open to different interpretationsThere is no account of what simplicity is, and no advance over Popper's "requirement of simplicity". Furthermore, Kuhn's appeal to simplicity faces the same difficulty we have seen arising in connection with Popper's appeal to simplicity. If "simplicity" is interpreted in such a way that it has real content, and is capable of excluding "complex" or disunified and aberrant theories or paradigms from science, then its permanent employment by science commits science to a permanent metaphysical assumption that persists through revolutions, something Kuhn explicitly rejects (and could not, in any case, provide a rationale for). If "simplicity" is interpreted sufficiently loosely and flexibly to ensure that no such metaphysical thesis is involved, invoking simplicity must fail to exclude complex, disunified, aberrant paradigms from science. Any Kuhnian requirement of simplicity, in short, must either be incompatible with the rest of Kuhn's views, or toothless and without content. Either way, Kuhn has no consistent method for excluding complex, aberrant paradigms from consideration. It should be noted that Kuhn is emphatic that no sense can be made of the idea that there is progress in knowledge across revolutions, the new paradigm being better, closer to the truth, than the old one (seeBut this is a disaster for Kuhn's whole view. Why engage in normal science if the end result is the rejection of all that has been achieved, all the progress in knowledge of that period of normal science being sacrificed when the science adopts a new paradigm? Kuhn's arguments for the progressive character of normal science, indicated above, are all defeated.

Perhaps the most serious objection to Kuhn's picture of science is the obvious basic unintelligence of its prescriptions for scientific research. Suppose we have the task of crossing on foot difficult terrain, containing ravines, cliffs, rivers, swamps, thickets. Kuhn's view, applied to this task, would be as follows. After debate about which route to follow (pre-science), one particular route is chosen and then followed with head down, no further consideration being given to changing the route (normal science). Eventually, this leads to an impasse: one comes face to face with an unclimbable cliff, or finds oneself waist-deep in a swamp and in danger of drowning (crisis). Finding oneself in these dire circumstances, a new route is taken (new paradigm), and again, with head down, this new route is blindly followed (normal science) until, again, one finds oneself unable to proceed, about to drown in a river or tumble into a ravine. This is clearly a stupid way to proceed. It would be rather more intelligent if, as one tackles immediate problems of wading through this stream, climbing down this scree (puzzle-solving of normal science), one looks ahead, whenever possible, and reconsiders, in the light of the terrain that has been crossed, what adjustments one needs to make to the route one has opted to follow. Exactly the same point holds for science. There can be division of labour. Even if a majority of scientists tackle the multitude of puzzles that go to make up normal scientific research, taking the current theory, or paradigm, for granted, there ought also to be some scientists who are concerned to look ahead, consider more fundamental problems, explore alternatives to the current paradigm. In this way new paradigms may be developed before science plunges deep into crisis. And just this does go on in scientific practice, as I have already indicated in the brief discussion of the work of Darwin and Einstein (and somewhat less convincingly, Planck). Another example of a new, revolutionary theory or paradigm being proposed in the absence of crisis is Wegener's advocacy of the movement of continents, anticipating the plate tectonic revolution by decades. Science is, in practice, more intelligent than Kuhn allows.

In sharp contrast to Kuhn, AOE does not merely stress the importance of "looking ahead", of trying to develop new theories, new paradigms, before science has plunged into crisis; even more important, AOE provides a framework for theoretical physics (and therefore, in a sense, for the whole of natural science) within which ideas for fundamental new theories may be developed and assessed.
