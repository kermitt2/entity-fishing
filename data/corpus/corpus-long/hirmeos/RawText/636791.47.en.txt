We can begin to see some of the reasons for Einstein's vehement rejection of OQT as a satisfactory theory (despite its immense empirical success). It was Einstein after all who, in a sense, invented quantum theory. Planck introduced the idea that the energy E of an oscillator of frequency  is quantized in accordance with EE==nh as a calculational device, not as a new hypothesis incompatible with classical physics. Planck's aim was to deduce his empirical law of black-body radiation from the basic postulates of classical physics. He was dismayed to discover that the quantization of energy contradicted classical physics, and he spent the next fifteen years or so trying to remove this defect from his derivation. It was Einstein, and initially Einstein alone, who appreciated that Planck's work spelt the downfall of classical physics, a new beginning being required. In this sense, Einstein initiated quantum theory with his paradoxical "heuristic" hypothesis that light consists of discrete quanta with energy EE==h, even though light also undeniably has a continuous wave-like character. For Einstein around 1905, the fundamental task of the new theory, needed to replace classical physics, would be to solve the riddle of the nature of quantum reality in view of its ostensibly contradictory particle and field aspects. No wonder Einstein was dismayed when the new theory was developed deliberately to evade and not to solve this basic quantum riddle.

But there is more than this to Einstein's opposition to OQT. As II have stressed above, the failure to solve the quantum wave/particle problem ensures that OQT cannot be interpreted realistically, which in turn ensures that OQT must be interpreted as making (probabilistic) predictions about the results of performing measurements. But this in turn has a variety of disastrouss-though rarely noticedd-consequences. For it means that OQT only issues in actual physical predictions if some part of classical physics (CP) is adjoined to OQT for a treatment of measurement. OQT alone can only issue in conditional predictions of the type::if a measurement of observable AAis made, the outcome will be one or other of the values (a 1  a n ) with probabilities (p 1  p n ),,with:

And even this goes too far::strictly speaking, according to OQT, a quantum mechanical state  can only be attributed to a system in so far as the system has been subjected to some preparation procedure, which must be specified by means of CP. Thus OQT, devoid of CP, has no physical content whatsoever. It is only OQT + CP which has physical content. But OQT + CP, considered as a fundamental theory of physics, is a disaster. It is (i)) grossly ad hoc or aberrant, in that it consists of two conceptually incoherent parts, OQT and CP. It is (ii) imprecise, because the circumstances in which CP is to be applied are only specified in terms of measurement, and the notion of measurement cannot be made preciseIt is (iii) ambiguous because the theory does not decide unambiguously between probabilism and determinism. It is (iv) non-explanatory, not only because of the ad hoc character of the theory, but also because the theory is obliged to presuppose some part of what it is intended to explain, namely CP. The theory is (v) severely restricted in scope in that it cannot be applied to conditions which exclude the possibility of measurement, such as early states of the universe.excludes the possibility of quantum gravity and quantum cosmology, since these would require measuring instruments, described in terms of CP, to exist outside space-time and beyond the cosmos, and clearly this is not possible. (These are points I have developed over a number of years: see, and especially 1988, pp. 1-8.)These six gross defects, especially (i) to (iv), ensure that OQT + CP is unacceptable as a fundamental physical theory. OQT + CP cannot justifiably be held to be part of theoretical scientific knowledge. (OQT + CP encompasses a great deal of empirical knowledge, but cannot be said to be an acceptable theory, constituting theoretical knowledge.) OQT + CP is as unacceptable as the absurd, empirically successful but grossly aberrant theories considered in previous chapters. In practice this point is beyond dispute. The vast majority of physicists, from soon after 1926 down to the present day (or down to 1993, when a version of this chapter was first published), have regarded OQT as an entirely acceptable part of scientific knowledge: they have been able to do this because they have been able to pretend that OQT + CP is really just OQT. In almost all the textbooks and physical journals, quantum theory is treated as if its postulates are purely quantum mechanical ones. As a result, OQT appears to be thoroughly non-ad hoc, precise and explanatory, as conceptually coherent and unified as any classical theory. But all this is an illusion. It is the outcome of pretending that the physical theory-the theory that has physical content-is OQT rather than OQT + CP. No such thing is possible. OQT, devoid of CP, has no physical content whatsoever. Only an all-pervasive intellectual dishonesty makes it possible to pretend that OQT alone has physical content (or that OQT + CP is really, somehow, just OQT).
