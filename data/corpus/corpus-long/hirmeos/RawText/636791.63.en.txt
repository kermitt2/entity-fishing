Why has this simple argument been ignored by the vast literature on the problem of induction (or underdetermination), referred to in note 8? Three factors are perhaps at work. First, accepting the argument involves acknowledging that science, as it is ordinarily understood (in terms of standard empiricism), lacks rigour. Our understanding of science, and even science itself, need to change if science is to become rigorous and make explicit, and critically assess, implicit, problematic metaphysical presuppositions. Philosophers, tackling the problem of induction, have perhaps been reluctant to take seriously that science, as ordinarily understood, is irrational and needs to be changed. Second, invoking a metaphysical presupposition of unity looks superficially like a well-known and hopelessly invalid approach to the problem of induction: justify scientific theory by an appeal to a metaphysical principle uniformity, and then justify this metaphysical principle by an appeal to the success of science. Aware of the vicious circularity of any such argument, philosophers have instinctively resisted considering the superficially similar, but actually very different, point that rigour requires that substantial, influential, problematic and implicit metaphysical presuppositions need to be made explicit-so that they can be critically assessed and, we may hope, improved. Third, the above elementary argument that physics makes a persistent metaphysical assumption about the nature of the universe has seemed impossible to accept because it has seemed impossible that the metaphysical assumption in question could ever be shown to be true, or probably true. But this objection profoundly misses the point. As I have already stressed, it is precisely because the metaphysical thesis implicit in persistent acceptance of unified theories when endlessly many empirically more successful disunified rivals are available is nothing more than a pure conjecture, very likely to be false in the specific version of it accepted at any stage in the development of physics, that it is vital that it be made explicit within physics so that it may be critically assessed, so that alternatives may be developed and assessed, in an attempt to improve the specific conjecture that is adopted. The impossibility of providing some kind of a priori proof of the truth of the metaphysical conjecture, far from being a good reason for ignoring its existence is, on the contrary, an overwhelming reason to make the conjecture explicit within the context of physics.

Presuppositionism does not, perhaps, entirely solve the problem of induction-the problem of underdetermination-but it does, when further developed, transform that philosophical and scientifically sterile problem into the scientifically fruitful problem of developing and choosing the most fruitful metaphysics for physics, as we shall see below.

5.3 Unity of physical theory

We have seen that physics only accepts theories that are unified, and this commits physics to presupposing physicalism. But what ought physicalism to be interpreted to assert, especially if physics is to comply with PIR?

In order to answer this question we first need to solve the problem of what it means to assert of a physical theory that it is unified. This problem has long resisted solution.confessed that he did not know how to solve the problem.

However, in Chapter 4, section 4.2, we saw how the problem is to be solved. Above, in the present chapter, I have indicated ways in which theories can be disunified. The solution to the problem of what it is for a theory to be unified, spelled out in the previous chapter, in effect extends and develops the above remarks about disunity.

A dynamical physical theory is disunified if its content, what it asserts about the world, is different, from one region to another in the space of all possible phenomena to which the theory applies. If the content of the theory differs in N ways, throughout the space of phenomena predicted by the theory, then the theory is disunified to degree N. For unity, we require that N = 1.

But, as we saw in the last chapter, there is a refinement. There are different ways in which the content of a theory may differ, from one region in the space of possible phenomena to another, some ways being more substantial, more serious as it were, than others. The most serious kind of difference, perhaps, is when the content of a theory differs in different space-time regions. A less serious kind of difference arises when a theory predicts no variation in dynamical laws in space-time, but predicts that there is more than one kind of force, or more than one kind of particle or field (there being one force, or one kind of particle or field in one sub-region of the space of all possible phenomena, and another force, or another kind of particle or field in another sub-region). In all, as we saw, there are eight different ways,, in which the content of a theory can differ, in different regions of the space of all possible phenomena that the theory predicts.

As we go from, the requirements for unity become increasingly demanding, with (6) andbeing at least as demanding as, as explained in section 4.2 of Chapter 4.
