This, once again, is tantalizingly close to aim-oriented empiricism. Einstein recognizes clearly that only in a very special kind of universe-a comprehensible universe-is scientific explanation and understanding possible. He recognizes that the particular way the universe is assumed to be comprehensible at any stage in the development of science will lead to rules or principles-such as Galilean or Lorentz invariance, the principle of equivalence, conservation of momentum and energy-without which physics would be impossible. And he points out that these rules are not final: it is to be expected that they will change as science advances. All this accords beautifully with aim-oriented empiricism. What violates aim-oriented empiricism is the suggestion that there is no Kantian synthetic a priori proposition built into scientific knowledge. According to aim-oriented empiricism, there are two such propositions, namely, partial knowability and meta-knowability at levels 7 and 6 of Figure 2.1 (see Chapter 2).We cannot of course know for certain that these propositions are true. They must remain forever conjectures-all our knowledge being conjectural in character. Nevertheless, we can be confident that we will always accept these propositions as a part of scientific knowledge. We are rationally entitled to accept partial knowability as a part of scientific knowledge because, if it is false, we cannot acquire knowledge of our local circumstances whatever we assume. There can be no circumstances in which it would be in the interests of the pursuit of knowledge of truth to reject partial knowability. And as for meta-knowability, accepting this proposition can only help, and cannot hinder, the pursuit of knowledge of truth, whatever the universe may be like. Both are synthetic a priori conjectures, accepted permanently because of the crucial role that they play in the pursuit of knowledge.In short, these two propositions are synthetic a priori statements not in the full-blooded Kantian sense that they can be known to be true of all possible experience with absolute certainty, but in the radically qualified Kantian sense that they are conjectures about reality-about the noumenal world-which must remain permanently an integral part of conjectural human knowledge, and which are adopted as knowledge on non-empirical grounds. This crucial tenet of aim-oriented empiricism is, it seems, explicitly rejected by Einstein in the above passage-even though the whole point of the passage, ironically enough, is to affirm it, affirm, that is, that science cannot proceed without the assumption that the universe is knowable, even comprehensible.

Einstein's ambivalent attitude to the crucial issue which separates off standard from aim-oriented empiricism gains explicit expression in the following quotation:

[The aim of science is to arrive] at a system of the greatest conceivable unity, and of the greatest poverty of concepts of the logical foundations, which is still compatible with the observations made by our senses. We do not know whether or not this ambition will ever result in a definite system. If one is asked for his opinion, he is inclined to answer no. While wrestling with the problems, however, one will never give up the hope that this greatest of all aims can really be attained to a very high degree.We might interpret this to mean that when Einstein is thinking primarily as a theoretical physicist, he unthinkingly takes the ultimate comprehensibility of the universe for granted-the key component of aim-oriented empiricism. When he comes to reflect philosophically about the aims and methods of his work, however, his (misconceived) philosophical conscience gets the better of him, and he lapses into standard empiricism. Einstein's scientific instincts, in short, are more enlightened than his philosophical reflections-an important point, implicit in my claim that aim-oriented empiricism arose, for Einstein, out of scientific practice, adopted in response to a severe scientific problem.

Are we to conclude, then, that Einstein did not in the end manage to free himself explicitly from the trap of standard empiricism? One point to remember is that throughout his scientific life Einstein's views on the philosophy of science evolved from something close to Machian positivism at the outset (an extreme version of standard empiricism) to a view that comes to resemble aim-oriented empiricism more and more closely towards the end of his life. Einstein himself put the matter like this, in a letter to Lanczos in 1938:

Coming from sceptical empiricism of somewhat the kind of Mach's, I was made, by the problem of gravitation, into a believing rationalist, that is, one who seeks the only trustworthy source of truth in mathematical simplicity. The logically simple does not, of course, have to be physically true; but the physically true is logically simple, that is, it has unity at the foundation. (seeThis, to begin with, sounds like a clear enough confession of a convinced aim-oriented empiricist. As it stands, it is perhaps something of an oversimplification. In the first place, as we have seen above, elements of aimoriented empiricist thinking can be found in Einstein's scientific work almost from the outset-from Einstein's first great creative period in 1902-5. Second, Einstein's views concerning the philosophy of science went on developing long after the creation of general relativity, right to the end of his life. Our best hope, then, of finding a clear, unambiguous formulation of aim-oriented empiricism is to look at Einstein's very last writings on philosophy of science. I provide two final quotations. The first comes from Einstein's "Autobiographical Notes", written when he was 67. Einstein is discussing the points of view from which physical theories can be critically assessed, quite generally:
