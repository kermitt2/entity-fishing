have shown, this attempted solution does not work. Not only does falsificationism fail to specify properly the methods that make progress in theoretical physics possible, it fails even to say what progress in theoretical physics means.

AOE solves the problem without difficulty. First, the fact that physics does proceed from one false theory to another, far from undermining physicalism, and hence AOE as well, is just the way theoretical physics must proceed, granted physicalism (as I have already indicated). For, granted physicalism, any theory, T*, which captures precisely how phenomena evolve in some restricted domain, must be generalizable to cover all phenomena. If T* cannot be so generalized then, granted physicalism, it cannot be precisely true. In so far as physics proceeds by developing theories which apply to restricted, but successively increasing, domains of phenomena, it is bound (granted physicalism) to proceed by proposing one false theory after another.

Second, AOE solves the problem of what it can mean to say that theories, T 0 ,  T N , get successively closer and closer to the true theoryof-everything, T, as follows. For this we require that T N can be "approximately derived" from T (but not vice versa), T N-1 can be "approximately derived" from T N (but not vice versa), and so on down to T 0 being "approximately derivable" from T 1 (but not vice versa).

The key notion of "approximate derivation" can be indicated by considering a particular example: the "approximate derivation" of Kepler's law that planets move in ellipses around the sun (K) from Newtonian theory (NT). The "derivation" is done in three steps. First, NT is restricted to N body systems interacting by gravitation alone within some definite volume, no two bodies being closer than some given distance, r. Second, keeping the mass of one object constant, we consider the paths followed by the other bodies as their masses tend to zero. According to NT, in the limit, these paths are precisely those specified by K for planets. In this way we recover the form of K from NT. Third, we reinterpret this "derived" version of K so that it is now taken to apply to systems like that of our solar system. (It is of course this third step of reinterpretation that introduces error: mutual gravitational attraction between planets, and between planets and the sun, ensures that the paths of planets, with masses greater than zero, must diverge, however slightly, from precise Keplerian orbits.)

Quite generally, we can say that T r-1 is "approximately derivable" from T r if and only if a theory empirically equivalent to T r-1 can be extracted from T r by taking finitely many steps of the above type, involving (a) restricting the range of application of a theory, (b) allowing some combination of variables of a theory to tend to zero, and (c) reinterpreting a theory so that it applies to a wider range of phenomena.This solution to the problem of what progress in theoretical physics means requires AOE to be presupposed; it does not work if falsificationism is presupposed. This is because the solution requires one to assume (a) that the universe is such that a yet-to-be-discovered, true theory of everything, T, exists, and (b) current theoretical knowledge can be approximately derived from T. Both assumptions, (a) and (b), are justified granted AOE; neither assumption is justifiable granted falsificationism.8. Discovery of new fundamental theories. Given falsificationism, the discovery of new fundamental physical theories that turn out, subsequently, to meet with great empirical success, is inexplicable. (One thinks here of Newton's discovery of his mechanical theory and theory of gravitation, Maxwell's discovery of classical electromagnetism, Einstein's discovery of the special and general theories of relativity, Bohr's discovery of "old" quantum theory, Heisenberg's and Schr√∂dinger's discovery of "new" quantum theory, Dirac's discovery of the relativistic quantum theory of the electron and, in more recent times, the discovery of quantum electrodynamics, the electroweak theory, quantum chromodynamics and the standard model.) Granted that a new theory is required to explain a range of phenomena, there are, on the face of it, infinitely many possibilities. In the absence of rational guidance towards good conjectures, it would seem to be infinitely improbable that anyone should, in a finite time, be able to come up with a theory that successfully predicts new phenomena. The only guidance that falsificationism can provide is to think up new theories that "proceed from some simple, new, and powerful, unifying idea", in accordance with Popper's (1963) requirement of simplicity, but this is so vague and ambiguous as to be almost useless. Famously, Popper explicitly denied that a rational method of discovery is possible at all (see
