Other families tried to relieve the pain of separation by imagining symbolical meetings with kin; it was believed that staring at the full moon would allow communication between relatives. As the daughters of Erdem-Belig remember, when they saw their father for the last time at the end of the Several years ago we found that Dari-Tsyrenns father finally had reached Hulun "uir.

s, he told them, Look at the full moon every fifteenth day of the month and think as if we see and talk to each other quoted from "alzhinimaeva . "t that time there was no postal service and no telephone calls. The official atmosphere of paranoia about foreign spies created a situation of general suspicion. The fact that someone had relatives abroad was already a crime, and the family would fall into the social category of untrustworthy.

Photographs and letters occasionally received from abroad would be destroyed and the names of relatives there could not even be whispered aloud. In public discourse people in exile were more dead than alive. All of these acts can be seen as violations of memory on an individual level.

Neighbours often informed on each other because of some personal antipathy, jealousy or desire for revenge. It was not so much having relatives abroad (almost everybody had then) but keeping contacts with them that was seen as a reason for informing and accusations. One family told me that their father, having been frightened by regular visits of the KG" secret service in the s and s, burned letters from his brother, who had moved to Inner Mongolian Shenehen. When his wife asked him, Why donnt you read them first?, his answer was Therees no need (khereg Ã¼gi to knoww it can be dangerous for us. This man felt that he was not even safe holding the information inside his head. The paranoia of the state produced a general atmosphere of fear, and this man seemed to have lost confidence in his ability to maintain a barrier between the inside and outside worlds. A sense of his own permeability, and total state control over his private life, made him feel afraid. The act of publicly burning letters, with his wife and son as witnesses, was done to reassure himself that not only he but also his family members would be more secure without knowing this information.

Other families had a different attitude and preserved their private narratives, letters and pictures hidden at the bottom of the chest  : "round the s I received a letter from my elder sister from Shenehen. She sent me a picture of my mother and my sister's daughter Tuyawho was born there. But I could not read it, because it was written in old Mongolian script. In Soyuz [the Soviet Union] we learned Cyril writing [Cyrillic script].

In Mongolian nomadic culture a chest (khanza) was a piece of transportable furniture provided with a length of adult dress (degel), where family keep all seasonal cloth and other valuable belongings. In this type of usage of the chest acquired an additional allegorical character linked with chronology and layers of memory. Upper layers contain everyday objects which are more often in use. Deeper strata often hide more precious and personally valuable things.

I heard that one repressed lama returned from gulag prison back to Tsogto-Khangil [a neighbouring village about km away]. Only he could read my letter, because other people couldn't read old Mongolian script. So one evening I rode my horse to his house. He read it to me, but also said not to show this letter to anybody and to burn it. I did not burn it and kept it at the bottom of my chest (khanza. I also kept some other letters that I received through peoplees hands from time to time, but I was afraid to show them to anyone. Even if I couldn't read them, anyway I was happy, that they remembered me, that they were alive and in good condition. I embraced the letter, cried, stroked the pages with my hand, and dreamed as if we were all together again, as if I went to see her over the border to Shenehen, as if she came to see me. When my sister came to nutag from China in the s for the first time after years to visit me, with her daughter Tuya, I opened my chest, took out her letters and asked her to read all of them, that she had written to me in the last twenty years Sanjit, years old, "ginskoye, Russia, .

The border-crossing regime in the late Soviet period, especially the Soviet-Mongolian part of the border, was relaxed compared to the Soviet-Chinese border, which remained strictly sealed until the end of the s. Some people were allowed to cross the border, but not everyone.

There were a number of special Soviet-Mongolian border regulations, which infiltrated categories of people who could cross into the frame of the official Soviet-Mongolian friendship treaties. "lexei Yurchak raises the question: what was the nature of the late Soviet system and way of life that had this paradox at its core? Exploring the period between mid-s and the mid-s, he criticises the prevailing binary characterisation of Soviet life produced in the west and later in the former Soviet Union and responds to the earlier argument of Susan
