Kuhn, in short, is quite unable to conceive of non-specialist standards of rationality. The Structure of Scientific Revolutionsbrilliantly reveals the glaring defect of specialism, and yet, perversely, is itself a defence of specialism, of specialist intellectual standards. This provides yet another illustration of the powerful hold that specialism has over the academic mind-especially when one takes into account the great success of Kuhn's book in academic circles.

The profound irrationality of science as depicted by Kuhn in his book can perhaps be brought out by considering the following comparison. Our problem, let us suppose, is to wend our way through an obstaclestrewn path, from A to B (from ignorance to knowledge). Kuhn's advice is to proceed as follows. Standing at A, arrive at a general idea as to how to get to B (a paradigm); then, with head down-one might almost say with eyes shut-set off, sticking rigidly to this general idea. Even if you bump into a wall, fall into a ditch, or get tangled in brambles (anomalies), nevertheless adhere rigidly to your route (normal science). However, if you seem to have got into permanent difficulties (crisis), you may open your eyes, look around, and hit upon a new route (revolution), which, however, you must stick to as rigidly as before (new phase of normal science).

This blind blundering about may eventually bring you to your goal, B. It is hardly, however, the most intelligent, the most rational way to proceed.

A rather more sensible procedure is to keep one's eyes open, and continuously adjust one's route (paradigm) in the light of what one sees and learns on one's way from A to B. In order to pursue science intelligently and rationally, in other words, we need to reconsider, explicitly and persistently, our most fundamental paradigmatic ideas as an integral part of science. Instead of adhering blindly and dogmatically to some paradigm until our difficulties have become overwhelming and we are forced to reconsider, we need rather to attempt to improve our paradigm even before insoluble empirical problems overwhelm us, taking into account important a priori considerations such as simplicity, coherence, unity, intelligibility, comprehensiveness. This was the way Einstein developed the special and general theories of relativity; Einstein was much too intelligent, and much too interested in discovering the "thoughts of God", to follow Kuhn's advice.To sum up this part of the discussion, specialized scientific problem solving cannot proceed unless some kind of answer is given to the question "What kind of world is this?" This answer is almost bound to be more or less wrong, standing in need of improvement. Hence it needs explicit, sustained, critical discussion.Specialized scientific problem solving dissociated from such critical fundamentalist discussion is irrational, as our glance at Popper's and Kuhn's work has shown.

Analogous considerations arise in connection with all other specialized academic disciplines, and in connection with the other three fundamental problems. Inevitably, in pursuing specialized lines of research, in history, for example, in literary criticism, anthropology, sociology, psychology, medical research or engineering, we presuppose some kind of rough and ready answer to one or other-or to all-of the four fundamental questions, this answer influencing our choice of problems, criteria for successful solutions, and so on. Since such implicit and influential answers are all too likely to be more or less inadequate, it is essential, for rationality, that these answers be explicitly articulated and critically assessed, as an integral part of specialized problem solving.In recent years a number of writers-so-called "externalist" historians of science and sociologists of knowledge-have argued in effect that specialized scientific, academic problem solving is substantially influenced by the social and cultural circumstances in which it proceeds. Material conditions, religious, political, moral and social ideals, human interests and values of one kind or another, all influence intellectual inquiry.(This may be understood as a generalization of the Kuhnian point that specialized scientific problem solving is influenced by paradigmatic assumptions.) Specialism insists that such non-rational influences must be kept to a minimum, and must be excluded altogether when results are being assessed, if intellectual inquiry is to retain its rationality and objectivity. Universalism, on the other hand, insists that such influences must be openly acknowledged and critically scrutinized if intellectual inquiry is to be rational and objective. If our task is to discover what is of value in life, and to help develop a better human world, then of course our thinking must not be dissociated from our personal and social lives, from our material circumstances, our political, moral and religious ideals, our desires and values. A basic task of intellectual inquiry must be to promote more rational problem solving in life, thus gradually helping us to develop a more rational human world; intellectual inquiry must not merely seek to shield itself from the corrupting influences of an irrational society, as specialism would have it.
