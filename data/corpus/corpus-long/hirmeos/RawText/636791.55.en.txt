To give an elementary example, Newton's theory of gravitation, F = GM 1 M 2 / d 2 is unified in that what the theory asserts is the same throughout all possible phenomena to which it applies (all bodies of all possible masses, whatever their constitution, shape, relative velocity or distance apart, at all times and places). An aberrant version of this theory, which asserts that F = GM 1 M 2 / d 2 for times t  t 0 , where t 0 is some definite time, and F = GM 1 M 2 / d 3 for times t > t 0 , is disunified, because what the theory asserts is not the same throughout the range of possible phenomena to which the theory applies.

Note that special terminology could be introduced to make Newtonian theory look disunified, and the aberrant version of Newtonian theory look unified. All we need do is interpret d N to mean "d N if t  t 0 and d N+1 if t > t 0 ". In terms of this (admittedly somewhat bizarre) terminology, the aberrant theory has the form "F = GM 1 M 2 / d 2 ", and Newtonian theory has the "aberrant" form "F = GM 1 M 2 / d 2 for times t  t o and F = GM 1 M 2 / d for times t > t o ". But this mere terminological reversal of aberrance or disunity does not affect the content of the two theories: the content of Newtonian theory remains unified, and the content of the aberrant version (which looks unified) remains disunified.

This almost suffices to solve the problem. A little more needs to be added, however, because in practice in physics, assessments of degrees of unity are somewhat more complex than I have indicated so far, owing to the following consideration. In assessing the extent to which a theory is disunified we may need to consider how different, or in what way different, one from another, the different contents of a theory are. A theory that postulates different laws at different times and places is disunified in a much more serious way than a theory that postulates the same laws at all times and places, but also postulates that distinct kinds of physical particle exist, with different dynamical properties, such as charge or mass. This second theory still postulates different laws for different ranges of possible phenomena: laws of one kind for possible physical systems consisting of one type of particle, and slightly different laws for possible physical systems consisting of another type of particle. But this second kind of difference in content is much less serious than the first kind (which involves different laws at different times and places).

What this means is that there are different kinds of disunity, different dimensions of disunity, as one might say, some more serious than others, but all facets of the same basic idea. We can, I suggest, distinguish at least eight different facets of disunity, as follows.

Any dynamical physical theory, T, can be regarded as specifying an abstract space, S, of possible physical states to which the theory applies, a distinct physical state corresponding to each distinct point in S. (S might be a set of such spaces.) For unity, we require that T asserts that the same dynamical laws apply throughout S, governing the evolution of the physical state immediately before and after the instant in question. If T postulates N distinct dynamical laws in N distinct regions of S, then T has disunity of degree N. For unity, we require N = 1. The eight different kinds of disunity can be characterized like this.

(1) T divides space-time up into N distinct regions, R 1  R N , and asserts that the laws governing the evolution of phenomena are the same for all space-time regions within each R-region, but are different within different R-regions.

Example: the aberrant version of Newtonian theory (NT) indicated above, for which the degree of disunity N = 2 in a type (1) way.

(2) T postulates that, for distinct ranges of physical variables (other than position and time), such as mass or relative velocity, in distinct regions, R 1  R N of the space of all possible phenomena, distinct dynamical laws obtain.

Example: T asserts that everything occurs as NT asserts, except for the case of any two solid gold spheres, each having a mass of between one and two thousand tons, moving in otherwise empty space up to a mile apart, in which case the spheres attract each other by means of an inverse cube law of gravitation. Here, N = 2 in a type (2) way.

(3) In addition to postulating non-unique physical entities (such as particles), or entities that are unique but not spatially restricted (such as fields), T postulates, in an arbitrary fashion, N-1 distinct, unique, spatially localized objects, each with its own distinct, unique dynamic properties.

Example: T asserts that everything occurs as NT asserts, except there is one object in the universe, of mass 8 tons, such that, for any matter up to 8 miles from the centre of mass of this object, gravitation is a repulsive rather than attractive force. The object only interacts by means of gravitation. Here, N = 2 in a type (3) way.
