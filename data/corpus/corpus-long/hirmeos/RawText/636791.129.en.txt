Both these points carry over when Popper's falsificationist conception of scientific method is generalized to form critical rationalism. Reason, quite generally, is at a loss without imagination. Imagination is required to dream up possible solutions to problems, which can then be submitted to severe criticism. Again, plurality of views is an essential ingredient of Popper's conception of reason. Criticism can only deliver a good idea as to how to solve a problem if there is a plurality of ideas to criticize in the first place. And merely in order to criticize an idea, one needs to have some kind of rival idea in mind, at least as a possibility. Rationality, as construed by Popper, requires plurality of ideas, values, ways of life; the freedom to imagine, to criticize authority, dogma and received opinion. It demands sustained tolerance of diversity of views and ways of life, together with the existence of traditions of criticism, so that good ideas may be selected from a pool of not-so-good ideas. Reason, as Popper emphasizes, needs to be seen in social, political and institutional terms). Thus, granted Popper's revolutionary conceptions of scientific method and reason, the "rational society" is not some kind of totalitarian society, but just the opposite, the "open society"-a society that tolerates doubt, diversity of views and ways of life, and criticism, and sustains individual liberty, reasonableness, humanity, justice and democracy. Reason, instead of being the enemy of freedom, individuality, imagination, democracy and justice, becomes the friend of these things, indeed essential for their preservation and development. As Popper puts it in a stray remark tossed out during the course of developing the argument: "We have to learn the lesson that intellectual honesty is fundamental for everything we cherish"

In The Open Society and Its Enemies, Popper depicts an epic struggle between those who have sought to help sustain and promote the open society (i.e. the rational society), and those who have opposed it. And he shows how even some of the greatest thinkers of the past have been beguiled by false ideas of science and reason into arguing for the closed society, above all,In these ways, the path Popper pursues, from his conjectural, falsificationist conception of science to its generalization to form critical rationalism, and its application to some of the most urgent and profound political and social problems of our times, represents an immensely valuable rediscovery and transformation of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment Programme. Popper's contribution is important and profound; but it is nevertheless defective. It needs further improvement. (Popper's followers, in so far as they refuse to consider the need for further improvement, do Popper a great disservice-and humanity, of course, an even greater disservice. At the heart of Popper's thought there is the insight that scientific method, and reason, rightly understood, deliver, not certainty, but rather uncertain progress, improvement, development, growth. 11 We betray Popper's philosophy quite fundamentally if we do not take it as a set of proposals, suggestions and arguments urgently in need of further development.)

In what follows I indicate how Popper's version of the Enlightenment Programme needs further improvement in two stages, which I shall discuss under the headings "The Improved Popperian Enlightenment" and "The New Enlightenment".

10.4 The Improved Popperian Enlightenment

A basic inadequacy of Popper's version of the Enlightenment Programme is that it depicts social inquiry, in highly traditional terms, to be social science, indeed pro-naturalist social science, with methods akin to those of the natural sciences. Popper's criticisms of some traditional views associated with social inquiry-his criticisms of historicism, historicist social science and Utopian social engineering-are excellent and decisive. But he does not carry through this criticism of traditional views far enough; he fails to correct the greatest blunder of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, namely the mistake of applying reason to social science rather than to social life! The basic Enlightenment idea, after all, is to learn from scientific progress how to make social progress towards an enlightened world. Putting this idea into practice involves getting appropriately generalized progress-achieving methods of science into social life itself! It involves getting progress-achieving methods into our institutions and ways of life in addition to science, into government, industry, agriculture, commerce, international relations, the media, the arts, education. But in sharp contrast to all this, the Traditional Enlightenment has sought to apply generalized scientific method, not to social life, but merely to social science! Instead of helping humanity learn how to become more civilized by rational means, the Traditional Enlightenment has sought merely to help social scientists improve knowledge of social phenomena (this knowledge then being applied to help solve social problems). The outcome is that today academic inquiry devotes itself to acquiring knowledge of natural and social phenomena, but does not attempt to help humanity learn how to become more civilized. Instead of social inquiry having, as its basic task, to promote cooperatively rational tackling of problems of living in the social world, its primary task, rather, is to acquire knowledge of social phenomena. Instead of being social methodology or social philosophy, social inquiry is pursued as social science. This is the blunder that Popper simply reproduces, and fails to correct. Popper, one might almost say, argues for the open society, but fails to argue for open social inquiry, for a kind of open inquiry devoted to promoting the open society by rational means.
