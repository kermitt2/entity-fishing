It may be asked how this succession of theories can reinforce physicalism when the totality of physical theory has always, up until now, clashed with physicalism. The answer: if physicalism is true, then all physical theories that only unify a restricted range of phenomena, must be false. Granted the truth of physicalism, and granted that theoretical physics advances by putting forward theories of limited but ever increasing empirical scope, then it follows that physics will advance from one false theory to another (as it has done: see point 7 of section 2.6 below), all theories being false until a unified theory of everything is achieved (which just might be true). The successful pursuit of physicalism requires progressive increase in both empirical scope and unity of the totality of fundamental physical theory. It is just this which the history of physics, from Galileo to today, exemplifies-thus demonstrating the unique fruitfulness of physicalism.

At level 3 that metaphysical thesis is accepted which is the best specific version of physicalism available, that seems to do the best justice to the evolution of physical theory. Two considerations govern acceptance of testable fundamental dynamical physical theories. Such a theory must be such that (i) it, together with all other accepted fundamental physical theories, exemplifies, or is a special case of, the best available metaphysical blueprint (at level 3), and physicalism (at level 4) to a sufficiently good extent, and (ii) it is sufficiently successful empirically (where empirical success is to be understood, roughly, in a Popperian sense).How does this hierarchical view of AOE overcome the problems and difficulties, indicated above, that confront any view which holds that science makes just one, possibly composite metaphysical assumption, at just one level? Given the one-thesis view, it must remain entirely uncertain as to what the one thesis should be. If it is relatively contentful and precise, more or less equivalent to the current level 3 thesis of AOE, then it is all too likely that this is false, and will need to be replaced in the future. If it is relatively contentless and imprecise, equivalent to theses at levels 7 or 6, this will not be sufficiently precise to exclude empirically successful but grossly ad hoc, aberrant theories. Even the level 4 thesis of physicalism is both too contentful and precise, and not contentful and precise enough. Physicalism may be false, and may need to be revised. At the same time, physicalism lacks the potential heuristic power to suggest good new fundamental theories which the more precise and contentful theses at level 3 possess. All these difficulties are avoided by the hierarchical view of AOE, just because of the hierarchy of assumptions, graded from the relatively contentless, imprecise and permanent at the top, to the relatively contentful, precise and impermanent (but methodologically and heuristically fruitful) at the bottom.

Any one-thesis view faces the even more serious problem of how this one thesis is to be critically assessed, revised and improved. The hierarchical view of AOE overcomes this problem by providing severe constraints on what is to be revised, and how this revision is to proceed. In the first instance, and even then in quite exceptional circumstances, only the current level 3 thesis can be revised. This revision must proceed, however, within constraints provided by the level 4 thesis of physicalism, on the one hand, and accepted, empirically successful level 2 theories, on the other hand. In a really exceptional situation, scientific progress might require the revision of the level 4 thesis of physicalism, but this too would proceed within the constraints of the thesis at level 5, and empirically successful theories at level 2, or empirically progressive research programmes at levels 2 and 3. The great merit of AOE is that it separates out what is most likely to be true from what is most likely to be false in the metaphysical assumptions of physics, and employs the former to assess critically, and to constrain, theses that fall into the latter category. It concentrates criticism and innovation where it is most likely to promote scientific progress.

Finally, any one-thesis view cannot, as we have seen, simultaneously call upon principles (1) to (4) above to justify acceptance of the single thesis, whatever it may be. The hierarchical view of AOE is able to do just that. It can appeal to different principles, (1) to (4) above, to justify (to provide a rationale for) acceptance of the different theses at the different levels of the hierarchy of AOE.Thus acceptance of the thesis at level 7 is justified by an appeal to (2); acceptance of theses at levels 3 to 5 are accepted as a result of (a) an appeal to (3), and (b) compatibility with the thesis above in the hierarchy. The thesis at level 6 is accepted as a result of an appeal to (4). Aberrant rivals to theses accepted at levels 3 to 5 (which might be construed to support aberrant, rival empirically progressive research programmes) are excluded on the grounds that these clash with the thesis at level 6.
