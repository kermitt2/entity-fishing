As it happens, Einstein himself makes clear in his "Autobiographical Notes") that he held the classical particle/ field problem to be of fundamental importance. 11 Having explained that theories are to be critically assessed from the two distinct standpoints of empirical success and "inner perfection" (unity or comprehensibility)-which in itself commits Einstein to aim-oriented empiricism (see below)-he goes on to assess critically Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian electrodynamics from the standpoint of inner perfection. We have here, incidentally, an adjunct to, and refinement of, Einstein's method of discovery: one theory is here taken at a time, and is assessed from the standpoint of "inner perfection"-from the standpoint, that is, of the capacity of the theory to provide a "perfect" blueprint for all of physics as far as the form of the theory is concerned. (In indicating the "inner perfection" defects of a theory, one in effect indicates, at least in general terms, what would constitute a "perfect" theory: one indicates, that is, a blueprint.) Einstein discusses six "inner perfection" defects in Newtonian mechanics, namely: (1) arbitrariness in the determination of inertial reference frames from an infinity of alternatives, and inadequacy of introducing absolute space (with respect to which all bodies have absolute acceleration as a solution to this problem); (2) two distinct basic laws (and not one), namely: (a) the law of motion (F = ma), and (b) the expression for force or potential energy (F = Gm 1 m 2 / d 2 ); (3) arbitrariness of (b) given (a), there being endlessly many equally good possibilities for (b) given (a); (4) the possibility of the force law being determined by the structure of space (the form of the force law being suggestively simple when viewed in geometrical terms), and yet the failure to exploit this possibility; (5) the ad hoc character of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass; and (6) unnaturalness of energy being split into two forms, kinetic and potential (seeAs far as electrodynamics is concerned, Einstein discerns one basic defect associated with interpreting the field equations as applying to matter and, in the case of the vacuum, to the aether. Einstein argues (perhaps not altogether accurately) that this defect was overcome by Lorentz in reinterpreting the field equations to hold essentially only for the vacuum, with matter, in the form of charged particles, being the source of the field. Einstein then remarks: "If one views this phase of the development of theory critically, one is struck by the dualism which lies in the fact that the material point in Newton's sense and the field as continuum are used as elementary concepts side by side"Einstein explains why attempts to overcome this basic defect by eliminating the point particle do not succeed; and he concludes: "Accordingly, the revolution begun by the introduction of the field was by no means finished. Then it happened that, around the turn of the century  a second fundamental crisis set in" (ibid., italics mine)-namely the crisis engendered by the first step towards quantum theory, Planck's quantum explanation of his empirical radiation law. If this is the second fundamental crisis, then the first is particle/ field dualism of classical physics. As it happens, the two crises are intimately interrelated, since Planck's law and quantum theory deal with the interaction of field and matter. There are good grounds, then, for holding that Einstein was concerned with problems from type (2) to type (5), as defined above, and type (1) problems where relevant, a type (4) problem of special concern to Einstein being the problem of how to unify point particles and field.

But did Einstein really invent an authentic method of discovery in view of his failure, during the last thirty years of his life, to discover the unified field theory he so ardently sought?

One reply can be made immediately: the method of discovery, indicated above, though rational, is also non-mechanical and fallible. The failure of the method to lead to a good fundamental new theory over a period of thirty years-even in the hands of Einstein-does not prove that the method is inauthentic.

But there is a much more important reply to be made. Einstein did not use his method of discovery in seeking to formulate his unified field theory. Or rather Einstein misapplied this method, in a quite elementary way.

After around 1930, the two fundamental theories that stand in most glaring contradiction with each other are general relativity and quantum theory. In order to implement Einstein's rational method of discovery from about 1930, the first step to take is to extract basic principles, P 1 and P 2 , from general relativity and quantum theory respectively, which contradict each other-this even perhaps being the nub of the contradiction between the two theories. The task then is to modify P 1 and P 2 (or something else) to form P 3 , a new principle which guides us to a new unified theory, T 3 , unifying general relativity and quantum theory.
