A chronology of land tenure changes in Tibet and Norway

For both Tibetan herders in China (drokba) and Saami reindeer herders in Norway, the basic unit of social organisation is the household, a nucleus or stem family. Traditionally, households often combined together and formed small cooperative groups that shared nearby pastures, called ru skor in Tibetand siida in Norway.In some parts of Tibet, ru skors were aggregated into higher order groups called tsowa.The tsowa has been predominantly described for the east and was organised around a lineage of a particular founding patrilineal clan that controlled bounded tracts of land.While the land rights of tsowa were fixed-unless and until other tribes took them by force-the rights of individual ru skor were fluid.In contrast, nomads in the central and western parts were all under direct state control.In principle, all of the land in Tibet was owned by the central government in Lhasa, which distributed the land among the aristocratic families, great incarnate lamas and monasteries for their upkeep and support. The nomads had to pay taxes and provide labour services to the institutions; in return the lord had to maintain law and order.Pastures were re-allocated at three-year intervals based on the herd size of individual households. Additional pastures were allocated to households whose herds had increased, and pastures were taken away from those whose herds had decreased.In Norway, the siida seems to have been the highest social aggregate, but following the Reindeer Law for Finnmark, from 1854 reindeer herding was formally (and physically) separated into different summer districts.Winter pastures on the interior constituted an overlapping quilt due to an absence of physical obstacles and because they were less formally governed.While pastures were technically Crown land, the siida formed the basis for user rights both within districts during the summer and on the winter pastures. In other words, the customary tenure system was based on siida user rights (albeit informal). While winter pastures were informally regulated according to siida membership-that is, Saami reindeer herders had a clear understanding of the fact that different winter pasture areas belonged to different siidas-when in need everybody had a right to access alternative pastures.In Tibet, the traditional system was effectively dismantled during a period of collectivisation. The Cultural Revolution-a campaign to destroy the 'four olds', that is, the old ideas, old culture, old customs and old habits-arrived in Tibet in the 1970s and almost destroyed the nomads' way of life.While the pastoral technology stayed the same, ownership of livestock and decisions regarding production were transferred from the household to communes, the collective production units. 31 Under the traditional system, only the distribution of pastures was controlled by the state; after the Cultural Revolution all aspects of economic and social life were fixed by state policies. Pastoralists were the subjects of commune leaders, and received work points, or 'stars', for their labour. The work points became the basis on which they got food, goods and cash.The Saami herders in Norway never experienced anything as disruptive as the Cultural Revolution. Nevertheless, while both the siida and household retained their positions (the household in some sense became strengthened at the expense of the siida 33 ), the traditional tenure system was dismantled with the 1978 Act. This Act introduced a system whereby the Saami own their herds while the rangelands-owned by the Crownare administered by the Ministry of Agriculture through the Reindeer Herding Administration which plans and regulates the distribution of herds and the grazing time schedule.The most disruptive aspect of the Act redesignated the autumn/ spring and winter pastures as 'commons'. It has been argued that as the 1978 Act did not incorporate any system for managing the pastures, it effectively 'led to the exclusion of the customary tenure system and, in the absence of a functional alternative regime, created de facto a situation of open access to resources' (p. 215).In the 1980s the communes were dissolved in China and the Household Responsibility System (HRS) was introduced. 36 In short, the HRS re-established the household as the basic unit of production and management decisions were largely devolved to households. For pastoralists, the HRS was implemented in two stages: first the privatisation of livestock and second the privatisation of rangelands.Since the dissolution of the commune system, Chinese government policies have emphasised that individual household tenure is a necessary condition for sustainable rangeland managementas well as increased production.By the end of 2003 around 70 per cent of China's usable rangeland was leased through long-term contracts, where 68 per cent was contracted to individual households and the rest to groups of households or to villages,although estimates vary.Consequently, the ru skor seems to have been destroyed in the east,while cooperative herding still occurs and provides a necessary component of effective livestock management in the west.In contrast, in Norway the traditional cooperative siida system is being formalised and used as a basis for re-distributing winter pastures. Reindeer herding is usually organised into summer and winter siidas. The summer siida was formally recognised by the Reindeer Management Act from 2007
