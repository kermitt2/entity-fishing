Invocation of a model: AOE recognizes that an important consideration in assessing a new physical theory is that it has a form similar to existing empirically successful physical theories. Thus the acceptability of quantum electroweak theory, and chromodynamics is much helped by the fact that these theories are similar in form to the highly empirically successful theory of quantum electrodynamics. All three theories, despite their differences, are locally gauge invariant quantum field theories. According to AOE, this requirement of similarity of form or structure derives, once again, from the requirement of unity). If T 1 and T 2 have some similar structures, then some part of T 1 can be modelled by some part of T 2 , and vice versa. According to AOE, having a model is only methodologically significant to this extent, and once again this requirement turns out to be derived from the demand for unity. (Of course, that physical reality is a model of a theory, in the sense that the theory is true, is highly significant for AOE; but this is not what MAI means by a "model".) MAI is, once again, much more open-ended in the kind of models that it is prepared to recognize as methodologically significant, and does not attempt to derive from the demand for unity the requirement that a theory should have some kind of model. Visualizability/ abstractness: According to AOE, neither visualizability nor abstractness are methodologically significant for theoretical physics. What does matter is that a theory can at least be interpreted realistically, as postulating that such and such a physical entity, (or entities), such as a field (or particles) exists, a stepping stone towards the ubiquitous, unified something of physicalism. (Actually, AOE demands more. It demands that fundamental physical theories are open to being interpreted in terms of conjectural essentialism (see) If one has acquired an intuitive understanding of a realistic theory, then one may well be able to "visualize" what the theory is about: to this extent, visualizability is methodologically significant, according to AOE, but once again derives from the demand for unity, via the demand for realism. MAI, by contrast, once again, is much more open-ended about visualizability, and makes no attempt to relate it to the demand for unity.

McAllister claims that opposition to orthodox quantum theory (OQT), by Schr√∂dinger, Einstein and others, stemmed from the loss of visualizability and determinism associated with the new theory. But this overlooks the key, entirely legitimate objection to OQT, namely its loss of microrealism, due to the failure to solve the quantum wave/ particle problem. Because it failed to specify a consistent quantum ontology, OQT had to be developed as a theory which can, at most, make predictions about the results of performing measurements on quantum systems-measurement being described classically. But this in turn meant that OQT is, quite essentially, made up of two quite different parts stitched together in a grossly ad hoc way, namely (1) the quantum part, and (2) some part of classical physics for a treatment of measurement. Despite its immense empirical success, OQT is still today deeply and genuinely problematic, to the point, almost, of being unacceptable, because of its grossly ad hoc character, due to its lack of micro-realism (seeThe mature Einstein was well aware that this is the basic objection to OQT, not lack of visualizability or loss of determinism, as we saw in Chapter 3. Elsewhere I have argued that the grossly ad hoc character of OQT, stemming from its lack of micro-realism, provides us with a general argument against instrumentalism and for realismI have also suggested how the quantum wave/ particle problem may be solved, and how a fully micro-realistic version of quantum theory may be developed, free of any reference to measurement or classical physics in its basic postulates, able to recover all the successful predictive content of OQT, but also making experimental predictions different from OQT for as yet unperformed experiments (see(This was done in an attempt to put the rational, but fallible, method of discovery of AOE into scientific practice.) There are, of course, other attempts at developing fully micro-realistic versions of quantum theory (seeEinstein's mature objection to OQT had to do with the lack of realism of the theory, but he did also, especially earlier, object to its lack of determinism. But here, too, there is a methodologically significant issue at stake, related once again to the demand for unity. A realistic version of quantum theory must be unified, first with special relativity, and then, ultimately, with general relativity. This is a much graver problem, granted probabilistic quantum theory, than it is if quantum theory is deterministic. The demand for unity speaks against probabilistic quantum theory-but not decisively: nature may well be probabilistic, and the task may be to develop probabilistic versions of special and general relativity

As for abstractness, this is, for AOE, without methodological significance, except that, as physical theory draws closer to capturing physicalism, it is almost bound to specify entities increasingly remote from those of ordinary experience. We begin with corpuscles, minute billiard balls, in the seventeenth century; these then transmute into point particles that interact by means of forces; these, in turn, transmute into classical fields, into quantum fields, into curved space-time, into superstrings in tendimensional space-time-entities increasingly remote from the familiar billiard ball.
