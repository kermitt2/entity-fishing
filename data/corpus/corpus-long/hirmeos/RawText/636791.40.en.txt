This only makes intuitive sense as a paradox in so far as electromagnetism is being conceived of in the absence of the aether.

As I have argued elsewhere, 4 there are strong aim-oriented empiricist, quasi a priori grounds for favouring the Faraday interpretation of electrodynamics over the aether interpretation, the view that the aether is required to make electrodynamics intelligible being a sort of metaphysical blunder. And there is an additional consideration. According to aim-oriented empiricism, the acceptability of the aether hypothesis is to be judged in terms of its heuristic and methodological power. But as ME was developed, up to 1905, especially in the hands of Lorentz, the role of the aether seemed to become increasingly tenuous. This, according to aim-oriented empiricism, counts against the aether approach. We may thus detect, in Einstein's adoption of the Faraday interpretation of electrodynamics, and his rejection of the aether interpretation, an instinctive allegiance to aim-oriented empiricism.

There is, however, another approach to resolving the clash between NM and ME. It is possible that the velocity of light is constant with respect to the source. Einstein tried this approach; he tells us that he abandoned it because of the complications to which it ledEvidence against this hypothesis only began to come in later, in 1913, with observations of double stars.

Granted, then, that the above two approaches to resolving the clash between NM and ME are to be rejected, we are left with the following situation: ME appears to be committed to the existence of a fundamental, absolute velocity-the velocity of light-just that which NM rules out. We have here, then, two good candidates for P 1 and P 2 , extracted from T 1 (NM) and T 2 (ME) in order to highlight the clash between the two theories, namely: P 1 : The laws of nature have the same form with respect to all inertial (non-accelerating) reference frames. P 2 : It is a law of nature that light travels with constant velocity c (in a vacuum). P 1 and P 2 together form, it would seem, a horrible contradiction. In order for P 1 and P 2 to be compatible, it would be necessary for a beam of light to have the same velocity c with respect to all inertial reference frames, even though these are moving with all possible velocities with respect to each other. Astonishingly, Einstein discovered how to make this apparently blatant absurdity entirely consistent. What we need to do is to modify our ideas about time and space, so that light does have the same velocity c in all reference frames. The basic postulates of special relativity are just P 1 and P 2 ::the many consequences of the theory arise from demanding that P 1 and P 2 be consistent.

More precisely, Einstein took P 1 as one of his basic postulates, but modified P 2 to become: P 2 *:: It is a law of nature that the velocity of light is a constant c in somee"resting" reference frame, and is independent of the velocity of the source. P 2 is then derived from P 1 and P 2 *. It is entirely understandable that Einstein took P 2 * as his axiom rather than P 2 interpreted to mean: it is law of nature that light has constant velocity c in all inertial reference frames.

To adopt this latter postulate is to assume as comprehensible that which only becomes comprehensible with the development of the theory. P 2 * is not initially incomprehensible in this way; on the contrary, P 2 * is a basic tenet of the Lorentzian approach, of the aether approach widely held at the time. How, then, is the contradiction between P 1 and P 2 to be resolved? Ordinarily we assume that the rate of clocks, and the length of rods, are unaected by uniform motion, temporal and spatial distances being frame-independent and absolute. Suppose we have two reference frames, R 1 and R 2 , with parallel axes, and with origins that coincide at t 1 =t 2 =0, the origin of R 2 travelling along the x-axis of R 1 with velocity v in the +ve direction, and the coordinates of an event P being (x l , y 1 , z 1 , t 1 ) and (x 2 , y 2 , z 2 , t 2 ) in R 1 and R 2 , respectively. In eect, we ordinarily assume that the coordinates are related by the "Galilean" transformations:

We assume, that is, that length and time are unaaected by motion, and that if a pulse of light has velocity c along the x-axis in the +ve direction in R 1 , then its velocity in R 2 isscc-v.

What Einstein realized was that if rates of clocks and lengths of rods are aaected by relative motion, so that x 2 ==x 1-vt 1 and t 2 ==t 1 are both false, then it is entirely possible that any given pulse of light has the same velocity c in both R 1 and R 2-indeed, the same velocity c in all inertial reference frames.
