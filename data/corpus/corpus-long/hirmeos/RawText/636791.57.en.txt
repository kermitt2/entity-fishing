For unity, in each case, as I have said, we require N = 1. As we go from (1) to (5), the requirements for unity are intended to be accumulative: each presupposes that N = 1 for previous requirements. As far as (6) andare concerned, if there are N distinct kinds of entity which are not unified by a symmetry, whether broken or not, then the degree of disunity is the same as that for, depending on whether there are N distinct forces, or one force but N distinct kinds of entity between which the force acts.

(8) does not introduce a new kind of unity, but rather a new, more severe way of counting different kinds of entity.require, for unity, that there is one kind of self-interacting physical entity evolving in a distinct space-time, the way this entity evolves being specified, of course, by a consistent physical theory. According to (1) to, even though there are, in a sense, two kinds of entity, matter (or particlesand-forces) on the one hand, and space-time on the other, nevertheless N = 1. According to, this would yield N = 2. For N = 1, (8) requires that matter and space-time are no more than aspects of one basic entity (unified by means of a spontaneously broken symmetry, perhaps).

As we go from (1) to (8), then, requirements for unity become increasingly demanding, with (6) andbeing at least as demanding as, as explained above.

(1) to (8) may seem very different requirements for unity. In fact they all exemplify the same basic idea: disunity arises when different dynamical laws govern the evolution of physical states in different regions of the space, S, of all possible physical states. For example, if a theory postulates more than one force, or kind of particle, not unified by symmetry, then in different regions of S different force laws will operate. If (8) is not satisfied, there is a region of S where only empty space exists, the laws being merely those which specify the nature of empty space or space-time. The eight distinct facets of unity, (1) to (8), arise, as I have said, because of the eight different ways in which content can vary from one region of S to another. 8

4.3 Objections

It may be objected that we never encounter the naked content of a theory, formulation free; we only encounter theories given some formulation. How, then, can we judge whether the content does or does not vary through the space S? The answer is that theories are not natural objects we stumble across; we formulate theories, and it is for us to ensure, granted we want our theories to be unified, that the content does not change as we move through S. We can arrange, however, that formulation matches content by ensuring that the terminology, the concepts, we use to formulate a theory do not surreptitiously change as we move through S. Given invariant concepts, if the form of the theory is also invariant throughout S, its content will be too, but if, for example, we surreptitiously change our units of length as we move through space, then a theory whose content is spatially invariant will change its form with changes of spatial position (a point which will be taken up again below).

It may be objected that, given any theory, however unified, special regularities will always arise in restricted regions of S, which means disunity. Whether or not the theory is unified is, at best, ambiguous. Thus, given NT, in some regions of S there will be solar systems with planets that rotate in the same direction and conform to Bode's law, whereas in other regions of S these regularities or "laws" will be violated. The answer is to distinguish sharply between accidental and law-like regularities; only the latter are relevant for the assessment of unity. But how is this distinction to be made? The answer is to adopt a suggestion made elsewhere) that physical laws are true if and only if corresponding physical dynamical (or necessitating) properties exist. According to this suggestion, Newton's law of gravitation can be interpreted as attributing the dynamical property of Newtonian gravitational charge to massive objects. Objects that have this property of necessity obey Newton's law of gravitation. (The empirical content of NT, on this interpretation, is concentrated in the factual assertion: all massive objects possess Newtonian gravitational charge equal to their mass.) If no such property corresponds to a true regularity, then it is merely a true accidental regularity, and not a true law. For unity we require that dynamical properties remain the same throughout S; the regularities of (some) solar systems, mentioned above, are not relevant because these regularities are not law-like, and no dynamical property exists corresponding to them.
