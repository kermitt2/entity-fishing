A central task of a kind of academic inquiry that puts universalism into practice is, then, actively to promote imaginative and critical-that is, rational-thinking about fundamental problems in personal and social life. What ultimately matters is the quality of the thinking we engage in as we live, guiding our personal and social actions and enabling us, at its

best, and if all goes well, to resolve conflicts and problems in increasingly cooperative ways so that we may realize what is genuinely of value to us in life. Academic thought has, as its ultimate purpose, to promote personal and social thought guiding personal and social life. In order to highlight this aspect of specio-universalism, here, in2, is another depiction of the view, emphasizing that thinking at its most important and fundamental is the thinking we engage in as we live, academic thought having, as a basic task, to promote the excellence of personal and social thinking guiding personal and social life. Critical fundamentalist intellectual inquiry can thus incorporate all possible conceptions of the world, all religious views, all philosophies of life, in all possible social and cultural milieux-all possible ways of conceiving of life's problems and how they should be tackled. There is just one proviso: all these diverse views and values, in being plugged into critical fundamentalist inquiry, as it were, must take note of the following basic points: many ways of conceiving of the world, life and its problems, exist and are possible; whoever we may be, our view as to what sort of world this is, and what is of most value in life, is guesswork; we have much to learn from others-especially by taking the achievements and failures, the views, values and arguments of others seriously, by ourselves engaging, with others, in critical fundamentalist inquiry, as we live. Sincere attention to the lives, views and values of others is desirable-and ought to be held to be desirable-within all viewpoints and value systems, since this is absolutely essential for mutual understanding in the world, mutual learning, mutual cooperation, peace, friendship and love. Much of the real richness in life comes from the good things that go on between people; and for these good things to happen, sincere attention to the lives, views and values of others-universalism built into the pattern of our lives, into the structure of society-is essential.

Universalism takes into account the point, stressed especially by Popper in The Open, that social, cultural pluralism or diversity is essential for the development of reason and science-the development of what Popper has called critical rationalism. I shall even argue, somewhat analogously to Popper, that rational inquiry can be understood as developing as a result of our departure from tribal life-from the human compactness and unity of tribal life. In sharp disagreement with Popper, however, I wish to argue that such things as mutual cooperation, mutual learning, understanding and communication can only flourish within social and cultural diversity if some kind of common unity can be discovered within this diversity. We must be able to agree at some level about what sort of world this is, and what is desirable and of value. Engaging in cooperative intellectual inquiry-the very act of participating in rational discussion-presupposes that it is at least possible to discover or create, at some level, common purposes and assumptions, an agreed framework, an agreed outlook on life and the world. This agreement must, however, accommodate equably the existing differences. It is in order to do justice to this requirement of unity in diversity-essential for cooperative rational discussion and inquirythat universalism postulates or stipulates the above kind of hierarchical ordering of problems and their attempted resolution. The hierarchical structure of critical fundamentalist inquiry is precisely what we need if we are to discover or create, as readily as possible, just, equable agreement within disagreement, unity within diversity. Agreement can be sought at the fundamental level: disagreement and doubt can then be rationally explored at less fundamental levels, wherever it arises.

In his best epistemological, social and political thought, Popper is centrally concerned to attack authoritarianism, the dogmatic attitude. In The Open Society and Its Enemiesthis concern takes the form of a mighty onslaught upon those major figures in the history of Western thought who, in Popper's view, have failed to come to terms with the strains of civilization-the strain of living in an open, pluralistic society-and, as a result, have given way to romantic longings for the cohesion of the closed society, the tribal way of life. It is this longing, this potent false nostalgia for a golden past, which Popper argues has led even some of the greatest minds, with the best of intentions, to become the enemies of the open society, the enemies of democracy, reason and pluralism, and as a result, tragically, actually helping totalitarianism and fascism to grow, with all the consequent appalling human suffering of our history.

Popper's diagnosis is of fundamental importance. However, in the midst of his ferocious determination to establish once and for all the intellectual disreputability and appalling potential human destructiveness of views which value the tribal way of life, Popper neglects to consider the possibility that there is indeed much to value, potentially, in the cohesiveness of the tribal way of life which humanity-science, reason and civilization-cannot do without. 12 It is just this possibility that is affirmed here. I shall argue that our departure from the human compactness and unity of tribal life does indeed involve serious loss. Mere pluralism is not enough. It is essential that we develop a common unified view of the world and ourselves through cultural and social diversity if there is to be mutual learning, understanding, and cooperation through diversity-minimal requirements for reason and for civilization. Only universalism can do justice to these apparently conflicting requirements of unity and diversity. In our emergence from tribal life into the modern world a basic task confronting us is to create and develop unity within diversity: only by putting universalism into practice can we achieve this in a just, equable, genuinely rational and humane way. Popper's ideal of the "Open Society" needs to be replaced by the ideal advocated in this essay of the "Fundamental Society". It is precisely our failure to establish universalism on a worldwide basis that is responsible for so much suffering in modern times, and which indeed at present threatens us all. (I refer here to our present worldwide incapacity to cope with fundamental problems posed by such things as the population explosion; the continuing rapid depletion of vital, finite natural resources; widespread poverty and malnutrition in the developing world; global warming; the proliferation, indeed the mere existence, of nuclear weapons, which threatens to engulf us all in the nuclear holocaust. A critical fundamentalist world order is, almost by definition, a world order capable of recognizing its fundamental problems and, where possible, developing and putting into practice, in a cooperative fashion, just, humane, effective solutions.)
