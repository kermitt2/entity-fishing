Consequently, manhood-related themes such as wilderness and breaking away from home, courage and heroism, domination over infertile land, of man over nature, and with it the conquest over 'uncivilised' communities and exotic indigenous females became defining features of outsiders' perceptions of the Arctic.Remarkably, until today, 'alternative ways of perceiving northernness are extremely rare'.Yet, while our collective Arctic image may have remained constant, others argue that it has slowly begun to change since the mid2000s as a result of embracing new, often climate change-related concepts that generated more nuanced perceptions.Of course, 'new' does not necessarily mean more gender-neutral. The obvious portrayal of heroic masculinity alluded to here seems less salient and less socially appropriate today, but our political and to an extent, scientific institutions still have concrete foundations based on such images of masculinity. They may dictate the type of personnel expected to reach and thrive inside the Arctic Circle as well as their likely behaviour. We can refer to the better-studied topic of military systems and quote Dixon: 'The argument is simply that a proportion of those [individuals] who opt for a career in the armed services ... will be attracted to organisations which set them upon the seal of masculinity ... being admitted to a society of men bent upon the most primitive manifestations of maleness'.Can we then expect that Arcticness is still affected by the potential of an assumed male prevalence in these realms?

Interestingly, some Arctic players are further reinforcing these outsiders' images in the effort to capitalise on increased global interest in the Arctic-for instance, through national branding initiatives. Iceland serves as a prominent example. Its tourist and state industries have successfully reproduced these images into a unique national brand that fits the globalised neoliberal world's commercialisation of distinct cultures, ethnicities, and exotic and isolated places.Thus, outside notions of Arcticness are reinforced by advertisements of the Arctic region as, for example, a moon-like, empty last frontier, by the selling of 9 boxes of 'fresh Icelandic Mountain Air' in Icelandic tourist shops, Rovanemi's (Finland) branding as the official home town of Santa Claus, and by cruise brochures' shiny images promising vast landscapes of ice, polar bears and the aurora while recalling the authenticity of past explorers' experiences. And what historically was often seen as a problematic, 'uncivilised' hinterland is now embraced by all sides-after all, indigenous people performing 'unusual' rituals and traditions are wellsuited to staging the sought-after authenticity.Consequently, perceived Arcticness is also manifested through the branding of the Arctic as a pristine, exotic, gendered, wild and uncivilised placeto attract adventurous, 'independent' tourists, enthusiastic to explore the allegedly 'undiscovered' and rough character of the Arctic, turning 'their holiday tours into a mode of exploration and their narrative personas from tourists to adventurers'.But, as Loftsd√≥ttir's analysis of Icelandic national branding efforts demonstrates, to succeed, such campaigns require 'already existing stereotypes and conceptions',filtered through the colonial past 'into the present, shaping contemporary global imaginings of difference' 28 that 'emphasise the association with the exotic, from which Icelanders had tried for so long to distance themselves'.Hence, perceived Arcticness serves as a branded commodity in a global marketplace. Arcticness represents, among other aspects, characteristics considered lost by so-called 'advanced' regions 30 which are valued particularly by younger generations who are influenced by neoliberal ideals.However, it is not merely 'economic actors' who are 'selling out' by defining and using what might be considered 'ignorant' outsider notions of Arcticness in order to make economic gains. Similar 'marketing' processes take place in the political realm, although with different goals and purposes: those of international strategic positioning. While an ostensibly descriptive and overarching term such as Arcticness may indicate certain regional belonging based on a more or less uniform set of national characteristics, this is not the case.

In line with increased popular, economic and political interests in the region, all eight Arctic sovereign states have published comprehensive national Arctic strategies, manifesting their belonging, legitimacy and interests in the Arctic.Most 'found their "Arcticness" only after the publication of the ACIA report in 2004'.Examining these strategies shows that all involved parties justify their Arcticness and, hence, their self-appointed legitimacy for tapping into the region based on partially differentiated sets of reasons that fall primarily into five categories: security, sovereignty, environmental protection, social and economic development as well as the governance and administration of the region. How these categories are then integrated into each nation's Arctic strategy, and their claims of Arcticness, depends on their unique geographical, economical, technological and historical starting points.Consequently, with uncertainty still prevailing over the region's tangled interests, institutions and future political constellations, carefully disguised power games may be the name of the game. That is, Arctic narratives emphasise Arctic international politics as essentially being characterised by peaceful cooperation among all the stakeholders.
