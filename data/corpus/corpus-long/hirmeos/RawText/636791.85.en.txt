It is this conception of science, postulating more or less specific, problematic, evolving aims and methods for science within a framework of more general, relatively unproblematic, more or less fixed aims and methods, that I call aim-oriented empiricism (AOE).(For further details see previous chapters, and) The basic idea, let me re-emphasize, is that the fundamental aim of science of discovering how, and to what extent, the universe is comprehensible is deeply problematic; it is essential that we try to improve the aim, and associated methods, as we proceed, in the light of apparent success and failure. In order to do this in the best possible way, we need to represent our aim at a number of levels, from the specific and problematic to the highly unspecific and unproblematic, thus creating a framework of fixed aims and meta-methods within which the (more or less specific, problematic) aims and methods of science may be progressively improved in the light of apparent empirical success and failure.This hierarchical view of AOE is put forward to solve the fundamental problem confronting presuppositionism, indicated above. It is put forward to solve the problem of improving the basic metaphysical assumption of science, implicit in persistent scientific preference for unifying theories even against the evidence, granted that some such assumption must be made, and that it is almost bound to be false. The claim is that the hierarchical framework of AOE provides the best possible means for discovering metaphysical assumptions which best aid the task of improving knowledge of truth; AOE provides the best possible means for improving choice of metaphysical assumption. There is no attempt to justify the truth of metaphysical assumptions. At most, there is a justification for choosing metaphysical thesis A over B granted that the aim is to make that choice which gives the best promise of aiding the search for knowledge of truth. Justification is involved only in the quasi-Popperian sense that the best possible justification of metaphysical assumptions that we can have is to expose these assumptions to the most searching criticism possible, to criticism best designed to promote progress in knowledge.

Something like AOE has always been implicit in scientific practice (otherwise science would have come to an end). AOE becomes all but scientifically explicit with the work of Einstein in discovering special and general relativity (as we saw in Chapter 3). Aspects of this work that are characteristic of AOE are the fundamental role played by the search for theoretical unity, and the vital role played by symmetry principles (such as Lorentz invariance and the principle of equivalence). These latter are fallible and revisable, and have the dual role of being both physical and methodological principles, all of which is integral to AOE. AOE, as indicated above, is intended to depict the metaphysical components of scientific knowledge given science as it exists today. AOE takes the specific form that it does in part because of what we have learned from Galileo onwards (or from the Presocratics onwards). History, in other words, is built into AOE. In the future, when we have learned more, AOE will be somewhat different. But however dramatic future revolutions in knowledge may be, we still ought to represent our knowledge in the same hierarchical form, with the same thesis, at level 7, at the top. Let us call this view "generalized AOE". When it comes to considering whether AOE succeeds in solving the problem of induction in a non-circular way, we need to consider various possible versions of generalized AOE which differ from AOE. The crucial question is, "Can sufficiently good grounds be given for preferring AOE to all other rival versions of generalized AOE that one can think of?" That is the proper way to formulate the problem of induction. (One striking feature of the problem of induction, as it is usually formulated, is its scientific sterility: work on the problem of induction has made no contribution to science, with the possible exception of Popper's work. But when the problem is formulated in the way just indicated, it is clear that it is potentially a highly fruitful problem for science: a version of generalized AOE that is genuinely an improvement over AOE is likely to be a major contribution to science itself.)

7.2 How aim-oriented empiricism solves the problem of induction

At this point, the basic objection to the whole approach being advocated here may be reiterated. Either AOE solves the problem of induction, or it does not. If it does not, no more needs to be said. If it does, then an element of justification must enter in. This in turn means that AOE must commit van Fraassen's mug's game. Choice of theory, at level 2, is justified in part by being compatible with choice of metaphysical thesis at level 3 or 4; this latter choice is in turn justified in terms of the success of science. We have here the vicious circularity of the mug's game. And it is inescapable. Interpreting AOE as a framework for detecting error, for criticism, does not help; even given this interpretation, there must be some justification for regarding metaphysical thesis U 2 as a better choice, an improvement over, more likely to be true than, thesis U 1 : here, unavoidably, justification is present, which introduces the vicious circularity of the mug's game.
