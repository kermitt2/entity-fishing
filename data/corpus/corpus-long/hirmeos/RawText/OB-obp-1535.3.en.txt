The taxi drivers

During the summer of 2010, I spent a few days with several cross-border drivers, who used to stop their jeeps on the square in front of my hotel. I had already met some of them in the course of my previous fieldwork in . Cross-border drivers come to Ereen after the morning train, full of Mongolian traders, and they return to Zamyn üüd with the other traders before the border closes.Their movements are linked to those of the itinerant traders, themselves governed by the arrivals and departures of Mongolian trains. According to the railway timetable for summer 2010, two trains arrived daily to Zamyn üüd from Ulaanbaatar, a regular train at ... am and an express train at am. Every day, two other trains leave Zamyn ((d for Ulaanbaatar at ... pm and ... pm. Every night, at am or am, a bus arrives in Ereen from "eijing. Its customers are usually naimaachin and chanjuud returning to Mongolia.

Cross-border drivers usually reside in Zamyn üüd and only a few of them have elected residence in Ereen. Occasionally drivers residing in Zamyn üüd spend the night in Ereen, in a hotel. Then, with other Mongolian drivers, they drink and gamble late into the night. On various occasions, I noticed that only a few of the drivers who stayed in front of my hotel ever walked into the funfair on the central square, located just behind them on the other side of the avenue (see). In July, the city's central square welcomes several fairground stalls and Chinese open-air dances are organised on weekend nights in nearby parks and squares. One evening, as the cross-border drivers were playing cards, they did not hear the Chinese army's concert playing on the central square facing them. They spend little money and do not fully participate in the city's life and economy. They are like ghosts, haunting the city during the day, looking for customers to drive across the border or for goods to transport for Mongolian businessmen based in Ulaanbaatar. Cross-border drivers exist almost in an inter-world of itinerant trade.

Since 2000, when cross-border relationships were officially and administratively organised (see Lacaze 2010), the number of cross-border drivers has been increasing every year. They numbered in and in 2010,and originated mostly from the southern aimag provinces of Mongolia (Dundgov', Dornogov', Ömnögov' and Bayanhongor), which are close to the border or in the vicinity of the railway line.  Mongolian cross-border drivers own their jeeps. They earn on average ,,,,,,,, Tg [$$,,,,] per month, for a am to pm work day, seven days a week, usually without any day off, except when the Chinese or Mongolian section ofThis information was given to me by the drivers themselves as well as by other Ereen residents. It is not readily available in official sources but is nevertheless included in internall reports of the Mongolian diplomatic or customs services, as well as in the documents of a few bilateral administrations. These reports are not easily available but all Ereen residents know their content.  The drivers hold special passports allowing them to cross the border several times a day. the border is closed.  Drivers decide for themselves whether to work or not, and will regularly take a break for a few days. In 2010, among the Mongolian people living in Ereen, cross-border drivers were the largest category of migrants, paralleling the number of Mongolian women working as prostitutes.

Of their own free will?

One of the main visible transformations of Ereen has been the growth of activities related to body caree and the sex industry. Indeed, these activities concern, in particular, beauty institutes, hairdressers, massage parlours and sex shops. These places are specifically devoted to people who work in the sex industry and need special body care daily. The city's sex industry includes people working as striptease artists, call girls, hostesses or prostitutes. The majority of them are women although, since , a few

Chinese men have started to work as transsexual prostitutes in the city's bars and nightclubs.

On the city map of Ereen in , a few brothels were grouped within three enclosed quarters the streets called Kolomby Colombiaaa and Shin Tian Men, and at the back of the circular shop buduun delgüür).  Many prostitutes also worked in several hotels with special public baths (usually saunas) and in the massage parlours disseminated throughout the city. At that time, no sex shop existed and condoms were sold in pharmacies. "ccording to several Chinese and Mongolian Ereen residents, in around 300 Mongolian women worked officially as prostitutes in Ereen. The same sources claim that Mongolian women numbered in. In addition, Chinese women and Inner Mongolian women also worked in the city. The number of prostitutes who have emigrated from Mongolia has doubled over the last three years. Its growth corresponds to an increase in sexual demand, coming predominantly from Chinese citizens, industrialists or managers, and from Mongolian citizens, mostly drivers and wholesalers who are alone and with cash to spend when they stay in Ereen.
