In Ereen, sex industry customers belong to different sexual cultures-Russified Mongols, Sinicised Mongols and Chinese-that consider prostitution as a normall phenomenon or usuall service for men seeking sexual satisfaction. Prostitution fully partakes in the Chinese sexual cultureee besides concubines, prostitutes play an important role in Chinese masculine sociality Micollier. It does not have the same place in Mongolian or Russian culture, even if they both largely accept extramarital sexual relationships.

In 2010, Shin Tian Men disappeared from the Ereen map. The several brothels that were located at the beginning of that street moved to  Shin Tian Men is likely to be a Mongolian rendering of the Chinese Xinjiang Men

another street, built in , called Jin Cho. The number of brothels then increased rapidly. By 2010, Jin Cho was a cul-de-sac with around sixty brothels, all numbered, one next to the other. In each red light housee or brothel, five to fifteen Mongolian women work as prostitutes. Jin Cho specialises in the higher scale of prostitution activities: the women who work there are under thirty and conform to the local standards of beauty, meaning they are thin, elegant and have white skin

The prostitution organisation

The Jin Cho cul-de-sac opens onto the main avenue of Ereen, through a visible arcade standing two gates away from the central police station, and it is enormously popular.  Although prostitution is forbidden in China "ttané , the Jin Cho brothels are duly licensed, officially  The first night I walked on the main avenue, there were so many cabs in front of the Jin Cho arcade that I thought for a moment that it was the new depot for the city's taxis.

recorded as commercial establishments-usually hairdressing salons-and their owners regularly pay taxes. According to the residents' points of view, the Jin Cho brothels are considered to provide around % of the city budget. Thus, the status of the brothels is quite ambiguous: they host forbidden activities but are officially licensed. At the same time, Mongolian prostitutes are officially recorded as individuals engaging in illegalities; they are routinely arrested by the Chinese police and frequently fined.

Since , the Mongolian frontier-police have been allowed to control people in the Chinese part of Ereen's Free Trade Zone. The owner of ger No. and many prostitutes in Jin Cho told me that this new allowance given to Mongolian border guards results in increased pressure on Mongolian temporary-permanent migrants, especially on prostitutes. When crossing the border once a month, Mongolian prostitutes used to bribe border guards in order to avoid the affixing of the black stamp, which then forbids them from travelling abroad for five years. The new bipartite regulation means that prostitutes now also have to bribe the Mongolian border guards who arrest them in Ereen. Usually prostitutes and pimps share the payment of the penalty equally, while the profits from sexual services are % for the pimp and % for the prostitute. Every month, women earn an average of ,,,,,,,, Tg [$$,,,,].

They regularly send money home or bring it with them when they go back. They can also borrow money from their pimp at a % interest ratee they have to work for a few days in order to reimburse the loan. Therefore they can take more money home than they have already earned. In this case, they will need to ask another woman in the same housee to act as guarantor for them. If the woman who has borrowed the money fails to come back, the woman acting as guarantor will need to work to reimburse this credit. Some pimps use this credit system in order to compel their girls to stay longer. During the twenty days I spent in ger No. , Lisa went to Mongolia for ten days when her mother was hospitalised, and later came back.  Emmanuelle left Ereen for good, after having worked there for around two months. Betty came back after a break of several weeks and Lola went home for a while.

Given their strong reliance on each other and the routine sharing of knowledge and secrets, the women develop very close relationships.

During working periods, prostitutes are also allowed to purchase their individual free time, in order to spend time together or with a close friend. When a woman needs to take some time off, she needs to inform her pimp if this falls during a period of rest, and at other times she will pay him his usual share of the profits. "nna told me she felt as if she were in a free jaill (chölööt shoroon. Indeed, if Mongolian women come in their hundreds of their own free willl, working conditions for prostitutes generally remain coercive.

In Jin Cho, pimps are mostly Inner Mongolian men, Horchin Mongols. Prostitutes, by contrast, are women from Mongolia. Each actor within the prostitution activities has his/her specific duties. The pimp officially registers women working in his ger as temporary residents. It means that he bribes the Ereen police and pays the official licence. The pimp's duties also entail providing a room for work activities (single tricks) and sleeping, giving condoms, and protecting the women when necessary. The ger regulations require prostitutes to be at homee at am when they have spent a night out with a customer, and to be ready to work at pm, after their daily preparation (public bath, shopping, hairdresser, make up), except if they are already with a customer. "fter am, when there are no more customers, they are allowed to sleep.
