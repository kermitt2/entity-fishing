Most scientists and philosophers of science recognize that nonempirical considerations of simplicity, etc., play an important role in science, but no one has been able so far to solve the terminological problem-problem (1). Weyl (1963, p. 155) remarked correctly that "The problem of simplicity is of central importance for the epistemology of the natural sciences". Einstein) recognized the problem but confessed that he was not "without more ado, and perhaps not at all" able to solve it.suggested that simplicity could be identified with paucity of adjustable constants in equations, but unfortunately number of constants can be changed by changes of formulation.proposed that simplicity is falsifiability, but unfortunately falsifiability can always be increased by adding on independently testable hypotheses which, in general, will drastically decrease simplicity. (Popper's adjunct proposal, in terms of dimension, does not work either, and is in any case subservient to falsifiability.) More recently,have sought to identify simplicity or unity with structural, formal or axiomatic features, but these attempts fail (seeEven more recently, Weber (1999),have tackled the problem without success-but see the excellent paper by Maudlin (1996) on unification of theoretical physics.constitutes an interesting attempt to solve the problem, and this will be discussed in Chapter 6.

4.2 The proposed solution

Previous attempts at solving the problem have failed because of mistakes concerning two crucial preliminary points.The first mistake is to formulate the problem, in the first instance, too generally as a problem about scientific theories. It is vital, in the first instance, to restrict the problem to fundamental, dynamical physical theories. Branches of the natural sciences are not independent of one another; they are interconnected. Biology presupposes chemistry, and even physics; chemistry presupposes physics; geology and astronomy presuppose physics; and phenomenological physics presupposes fundamental physics. All branches of natural science besides theoretical physics, in other words, are constrained by results from some more fundamental science that, in the end, can be traced back to theoretical physics. This is neither a pro-nor anti-reductionist thesis; it is just the simple observation that theories in non-physical branches of natural science are, in the end, in general, exceptions aside, constrained by physics. Only in fundamental theoretical physics does the question of the nature of non-empirical constraints on theories arise in something like a naked, pure form. We must, in the first instance, restrict the problem to that of fundamental, dynamical physical theory.

The second mistake is to suppose that simplicity, unity, etc., is a feature of the theory itself, its axiomatic structure, its simplicity of formulation, its number of postulates, its characteristic pattern of derivations, its number of adjustable constants. But all this involves looking at entirely the wrong thing. What one needs to look at is not the theory itself, but at the world, or rather at what the theory says about the world, the content of the theory, in other words. At a stroke, the worst aspect of the problem of what unity is vanishes. No longer does one face the terminological problem of unity-the problem of the formulation-dependent nature of unity. Suppose we have a given theory, T, which is formulated in N different ways, some formulations exhibiting T as beautifully unified, others as horribly complex and disunified, but all formulations being interpreted in precisely the same way, so as to make precisely the same assertion about the world. If unity has to do exclusively with content, then all these diverse formulations of T, having the same content, have precisely the same degree of unity. The variability of apparent unity with varying formulations of one and the same theory, T, (given some specific interpretation), which poses such an insurmountable problem for traditional approaches to the problem, poses no problem whatsoever for the thesis that unity has to do with content. Variability of formulation of a theory which leaves its content unaffected is wholly irrelevant: the unity of the theory is unaffected.

But now we have a new problem: How is the unity of the content of a theory to be assessed? What exactly does it mean to assert that a dynamical physical theory has a unified content?

What it means is that the theory has the same content throughout the range of possible phenomena to which the theory applies. Unity, in other words, means that there is just one content throughout the range of possible phenomena to which the theory applies. If the theory postulates different contents, different laws, for different ranges of possible phenomena, then the theory is disunified, and the more such different contents there are, so the more disunified the theory is. Thus "unity" means "one", and "disunity" means "more than one", the disunity becoming worse and worse as the number of different contents goes up, from two to three to four, and so on. Not only does this enable us to distinguish between "unified" and "disunified" theories, it enables us to assign "degrees of unity" to theories, or to partially order theories with respect to their degree of unity.
