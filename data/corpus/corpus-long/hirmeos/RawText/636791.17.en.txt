The conception of science expounded by Thomas Kuhn in his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1970a) shares important elements with Popper's falsificationism. The big difference is that whereas Kuhn holds that "normal science" is an important, healthy and entirely rational (indeed, the most rational) part of science, Popper regards normal science as "dogmatic", the result of bad education and "indoctrination", something that is "a danger to science and, indeed, to our civilization"It is the apparent persistent dogmatism of normal science-the persistent retention of the current paradigm in the teeth of ostensible empirical refutations-that is so irrational, so unscientific, when viewed from a falsificationist perspective. AOE, however, though subjecting scientific assumptions to even greater critical scrutiny than Popper's falsificationism, turns out to have features which are, in some respects, closer to Kuhn than to Popper. For, according to AOE, substantial and influential metaphysical assumptions are persistently accepted as a part of scientific knowledge in a way which seems much closer to the way paradigms are accepted, according to Kuhn, during normal science, than to the way falsifiable theories are to be treated in science, according to Popper. AOE depicts science as, quite properly, proceeding in a way that is reminiscent, in important respects, of Kuhn's normal science, something that is anathema to Popper's falsificationism. At the same time, AOE is free of some of the serious defects inherent in Kuhn's conception of science. Even though AOE science mimics some aspects of Kuhnian normal science, it nevertheless entirely lacks the harmful dogmatism of this kind of science, and avoids problems that arise from Kuhn's insistence that successive paradigms are "incommensurable".

Imre Lakatos's "methodology of scientific research programmes" 4 was invented, specifically, to do justice both to Popper's insistence on the fundamental importance of subjecting scientific theories to persistent, ruthless attempted empirical refutation, and to Kuhn's insistence on the importance of preserving accepted paradigms from refutation, scientists, not paradigms, being under test when ostensible refutations arise. It is, like AOE, a kind synthesis of the ideas of Popper and Kuhn. Just as AOE incorporates elements of Popper and Kuhn, so too it incorporates elements of Lakatos's research programme methodology. At the same time, AOE is an improvement over Lakatos's view; it solves problems which Lakatos's view is unable to solve. Whereas Lakatos's view provides no means for the assessment of "hard cores" (Lakatos's "paradigms") other than by means of the empirical success and failure of the research programmes to which they give rise, AOE specifies a way in which "hard cores" (or their equivalent) can be rationally, but fallibly assessed, independent of the kind of empirical considerations to which Lakatos is restricted. This has important implications for the question of whether or not there is a rational method of discovery. It also has important implications for the strength of scientific method. For Lakatos, notoriously, scientific method could only decide which of two competing research programmes was the better long after the event, when one had proved to be vastly superior, empirically, to the other. "Minerva's owl flies at night," as Lakatos put it, echoing Hegel. AOE provides a much more decisive methodology than Lakatos's, one which is able to deliver verdicts when they are needed, and not long after the event.

It may be thought that yet another critique of Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos is unnecessary, given the flood of literature that has appeared on the subject in the last 40 years or so. 5 My reply to this objection comes in two parts.

First, nowhere in this large body of critical literature can one find the particular line of criticism developed in the present chapter.This line of criticism is, furthermore, especially fundamental and insightful in that it reveals, as other criticisms do not, what needs to be done radically to improve the views of Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos. Second, the improved view, namely AOE, that emerges from the criticism to be expounded here, has been entirely overlooked by the body of literature discussing and criticizing Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos. This is the decisive point. It is not enough merely to show that the views of Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos are defective. What really matters is to develop a view that overcomes these defects. That is what I set out to do here.

It is also true that, during the last 30 years, a substantial body of work has emerged on scientific method quite generally.In none of these works does one find the criticism of Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos, expressed below, or the synthesis, namely AOE, which emerges from this criticism. 8 Furthermore, the methodological views developed in the works just cited all fall to the line of criticism deployed against Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos in the present chapter. There is no space to develop this last point here: it is, however, spelled out inas far as works up to that date are concerned. One implication, then, of the present chapter is that philosophy of science took a wrong turning around 1974 when it failed to take up the line of argument spelled out here, an early version of which is to be found in Maxwell (1974).
