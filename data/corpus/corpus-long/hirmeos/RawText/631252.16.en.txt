2.5 Liquids

We reconstruct two liquids *l and *r in pAP, though *r and *j may have been allophones of a single phoneme in pAP (see Section 2 above). For expository purposes we treat *r as if it were a phoneme in the present section. There is a relatively regular and unchanging correspondence of initial and medial l in the modern languages from which the existence of pAP *l can be posited. However, few forms are distributed widely across the languages, making it difficult to reconstruct words with initial *l. Correspondences supporting initial *l include 'rattan', 'crouch', 'bark', 'walk', and 'far'.

Medial *l is supported by correspondence sets 'axe', 'bathe', 'tongue', and 'sky'. A few languages show evidence of sporadic *l > i, for example, Wersing jebur 'tongue' < *-lebur. The Pantar languages Teiwa, Nedebang, and Kaera, show irregular loss of medial *l in 'six'. Kamang regularly loses *l between non-front vowels (see Chapter 3), and thus *talam > Kamang tama is expected.

In final position, however, Teiwa, Kaera, and Kamang reflect *l > i. This final vowel may be realized phonetically as a glide in the modern languages; however, we analyze these phonemically as vowels and assume the same analysis for pAP. Adang reflects both l and i in final position. Synchronically, Adang is losing final l among younger speakers and certain dialects, though this only occurs following a sequence of two vowels in final position *Vil > Vi/__#). Further, Nedebang and Western Pantar lose final *l altogether. Thus, Teiwa muui, Kaera mogoi, Western Pantar magi, Adang m i, Klon mgol, Kamang moi, Wersing mulul < pAP *mogol 'banana'. Other correspondence sets supporting final *l include 'child', 'bird', and 'bat'.

We find insufficient evidence to reconstruct *r in initial position. In non-initial position pAP clearly distinguished two liquids, and this distinction is preserved in most of the languages. In medial position Nedebang, Western Pantar, and Adang collapse *l and *r as l (the reflexes in Kamang are less consistent). Abui Gary Holton & Laura C. Robinson reflects *r > j, represented synchronically as a vowel in final position. The other languages preserve *r as such. This leaves no direct historical source for r in Nedebang, Western Pantar, and Adang, and we assume that r in these languages has been innovated or diffused from neighboring languages. In modern Western Pantar forms with r are infrequent and do not correspond regularly to other languages. In most cases they reflect lexical innovation, as in Western Pantar re 'bird' (compare pAP *(a)dVl). Correspondence sets supporting medial *r include 'two', 'water', 'sing', 'bone', 'ear', 'tail', and 'laugh'.

The correspondences for final *r are similar to those in medial position, except *r > j (represented here synchronically as a vowel) in Kamang and *r > Ã˜ in Nedebang and Western Pantar.Adang reflexes of final *r reflect both l and i, as do its reflexes for final *l. Correspondence sets supporting final *r include 'stone', 'scorpion', 'lime', 'maize', 'tongue', and 'moon'.

We reconstruct the two glides *w and *j to pAP. In most languages *w is preserved as w in all positions. In initial position only Blagar v and Adang f < *w reflect a change; other languages preserve *w. Correspondence sets supporting initial *w include 'sun', 'blood', 'stone', and 'bathe'. The form 'blood' is illustrative, as it has a reflex in every language: Teiwa wai, Nedebang we, Kaera we, Western Pantar wai, Blagar v, Adang foi, Klon we, Kui we, Abui wea, Kamang we, Sawila wi, Wersing wei.

We find insufficient evidence to reconstruct *w in non-initial position. Potential correspondences representing non-initial *w are likely either to be underlying vowels or to reflect original initial *w. For example, the root-initial consonant in the word for 'ear' is usually analyzed as a glide: Klon-wer, Kui wel, Abui wei, Kamang wai, Sawila-wari, and Wersing weri. However, regardless of the synchronic analyses these forms are likely to reflect an original vocalic form and we reconstruct pAP *uari. Apparent medial *w is also found in the word for 'lime', Kaera awar, Western Pantar hauwe, Blagar avar, Adang afai, Abui awai, Kamang awoi. This correspondence matches that for initial *w and even supports reconstruction of pAP *hawar 'lime'. However, this form is likely to be an original compound; compare *war 'stone'. Another example of a potential compound containing medial *w is found in the word for 'five', reconstructed as *jiwesin.
