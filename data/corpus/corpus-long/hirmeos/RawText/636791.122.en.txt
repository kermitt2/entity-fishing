In so far as a basic organizing assumption is built into present-day scientific, academic inquiry, it is that the aim of such inquiry is to improve objective, impersonal, institutional knowledge, not personal and social wisdom. Intellectual priority is not given to our problems of living, to the difficulties, frustrations and sufferings that we encounter in our lives in attempting to discover and achieve what is of value in life: on the contrary, intellectual priority is given to impersonal problems of knowledge encountered by the various academic disciplines in seeking to describe, predict and explain phenomena. Even the social sciences give intellectual priority to problems of knowledge as they arise within sociology, psychology, and so on, rather than to the problems encountered by people in their lives. Intellectual progress is assessed, not in terms of the success we meet with in achieving what is of value in life, but rather in terms of the success achieved in acquiring academic knowledge. Intellectual progress is conceived as being decisively dissociated from human, social progress.

Impersonal, academic problems of knowledge may of course be tackled out of a concern to develop knowledge which can subsequently be used or applied to help solve human, social problems. The all-important point, however, is that these problems of knowledge are neither understood nor tackled as intellectually subordinate to our more fundamental problems of living, but are, on the contrary, decisively dissociated from these. If science is to be of human value, it tends to be argued, it is essential that science acquires reliable, objective, impersonal factual knowledge, this in turn requiring-so the argument goes-that the problems of knowledge be tackled in a way which is decisively dissociated from the problems of life.

From the standpoint of developing a kind of intellectual inquiry designed to help us achieve what is of value in life, however, all this is irrational in a quite elementary fashion, and for precisely the reasons emphasized throughout this essay. Granted that the fundamental task of intellectual inquiry is to help us solve those personal, social problems of living we encounter in seeking to achieve what is of value in life, elementary rules of rational problem solving require us to give intellectual priority to the task of articulating these personal, social problems of living, and proposing and criticizing possible (and actual) solutions to them. Rationality also requires, of course, that we develop a multitude of subordinate, specialized problems-for example, technological problems, scientific problems, problems of knowledge and understanding. It is absolutely essential for rationality, however, that these specialized problems are understood as subordinate, the enterprise of tackling them being set within the framework of the more fundamental intellectual activity of proposing and criticizing possible solutions to our problems of living.

The philosophy of knowledge is, as I have said, at present almost universally taken for granted by the academic community, and is built into the whole institutional structure of the scientific, academic enterprise. As a result, the elementary irrationality of this philosophy has damaging repercussions for the whole of intellectual inquiry, and indeed for the whole modern world, all our lives here on earth. Both "applied" and "pure" intellectual inquiry, it should be noted, are damaged by the general acceptance of the philosophy of knowledge.On the one hand we may-with Bacon, Comte, Bernal and Ravetz, for example-be concerned primarily with the capacity of intellectual inquiry to help us solve our practical social problems. If so, then according to the philosophy of wisdom, intellectual priority needs to be given to articulating these problems, and proposing and criticizing possible solutions. Solutions to practical social problems are appropriate personal, social actions. Hence, according to the philosophy of wisdom, the fundamental intellectual task of intellectual inquiry is to develop imaginatively and assess critically possible and actual personal, social actions. The development of knowledge and technology needs to be rationally subordinated to the more fundamental intellectual activity of proposing and criticizing social actions.

The philosophy of knowledge, however, gives intellectual priority to the development of knowledge divorced from a concern with our social problems. New knowledge leads to the development of new technology which is then applied in ways which help, we may hope, to solve these problems. The crucial point, however, is that intellectual priority is given to the task of proposing and criticizing claims to knowledge-laws, theories, experimental results-instead of possible social actions.

Inevitably, as a direct result of giving intellectual priority to the development of knowledge rather than to proposing and criticizing possible solutions to social problems, intellectual inquiry must (1) fail to help us solve all those major social problems which require new social actions, policies and institutions for their resolution rather than new knowledge and technology; (2) fail to help us give priority to the development of new knowledge and technology most needed for the resolution of urgent social problems; (3) fail to help us use such knowledge and technology, where developed, to maximum advantage in a rational fashion to help solve social problems; (4) fail to help us anticipate and prevent new knowledge and technology being used in socially harmful ways; (5) fail to help us anticipate and refrain from engaging in intrinsically harmful scientific research; and (6) fail to concentrate intellectual attention on our most urgent social problems. 52 These six kinds of failure are all immediate consequences of the fundamental failure to give intellectual priority to rational human, social problem solving. As long as our thinking about the world and ourselves is dominated by the philosophy of knowledge, it is almost inevitable that the social ills of the modern world will arise, even if almost everyone acts with good will.
