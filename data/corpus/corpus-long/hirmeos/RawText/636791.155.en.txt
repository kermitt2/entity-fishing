In short, despite their diversity, the four positions just outlined have one crucial failing in common: they all fail to emphasize that rational action involves quite essentially seeking to improve our aims and methods as we act-the key tenet of aim-oriented rationality (see41. For a fascinating account of such a hunting and gathering tribal life, see) especially clearly and convincingly on this point, in part from personal experience. 43. A humane, cooperative, mutually understanding, pluralistic society presupposes and is, in a sense, presupposed by, universalism. If two people, two societies or two cultures, giving different answers to our four fundamental problems, are to act humanely and cooperatively together, there must be mutual understanding; this requires that each is able to imagine, at least as a possibility, that the other's answers are correct (or at least an improvement, in certain respects, over his own). This in turn requires that each recognizes the genuineness of the four fundamental problems. If each is to learn from the other, then each must acknowledge the genuineness of the four fundamental problems. On the other hand, to recognize that these problems are genuine is to imagine at least the possibility of answers different from one's own being given-which is to imagine a pluralistic society, at least as a possibility. Only universalism can do justice to the Socratic and Kantian idea that Reason forms a basis for the unity of mankind. 44. "Reason, like language, can be said to be a product of social life"See also the discussion of the claim that science is necessarily social in character, "Robinson Crusoe science", however successful, being necessarily only "revealed science" in that it must lack objectivity, pluralistic criticism (ibid., pp.Unfortunately, Popper in his later work fails lamentably to develop these anticipations of the point stressed in this chapter (see, for example, note 40), that reason, epistemology, thought, intellectual inquiry, all need to be conceived of, and developed, as personal and social in character, in the world, a part of life. If we adopt the view advocated in section 9.7 that the aim of intellectual inquiry is to help us achieve wisdom, life of value, then the fundamental aim of intellectual inquiry becomes a personal, social aim, and the problems of intellectual inquiry become, fundamentally, personal, social problems of living. Our central task, in pursuing intellectual inquiry, becomes to help develop more rational, wiser ways of living, institutions, social orders. The split between personal, social aims and intellectual aims-the split between personal, social action and thought-disappears. Popper, however, holds that the basic aim of intellectual inquiry is to develop impersonal, objective knowledge. This leads him to develop his "world 3" theory of the intellectual domain. As a result, and quite disastrously, the fundamental personal and social problems of intellectual inquiry-problems we encounter in helping to develop life of value, a wiser world-are transformed into the pseudo metaphysical-neurological problems of how "world 3" can interact with the mind and the brain (see

Universalism, in sharp disagreement with Popper, recognizes just one world. Within universalism, Popper's conceptually incoherent psycho-neurological thesis that world 3 interacts with world 1 via world 2, can be replaced by the kind of conceptually coherent psycho-neurological postulate indicated in note 11, or by a version of this postulate which asserts that aim-oriented rationalism is programmed into the neurological structure of our brains-or at least needs to be so "programmed" if we are to be able to achieve what is of value in life. (For an exposition of aim-oriented rationalism, see the Prologue and Chapter 10. See alsoThere is only one world; it is in this world that universalism and aim-oriented rationalism need to flourish. In order to help achieve this, it is essential that we see critical fundamentalist intellectual standards, aim-oriented rationality, as something embedded, actually and potentially, in this world. It is essentially this insight that we need to see implicit in much ofin order to appreciate the real value of that work, and in order to make sense of Popper's wonderful suggestion that we should see intellectual evolution as a development of biological evolution. In the circumstances it is somewhat tragic that Popper should have gone on, with the development of his three-world view, to reject explicitly the insight that reason needs to be seen as materially and socially embodied in this one world. 45. According to Popper, we must learn to live with the intense emotional strain of civilization, as the price that must be paid for reason, for the open society, for civilization. Any attempt to introduce social and cultural changes which alleviate this strain must be fiercely resisted, as such changes must inevitably lead to totalitarianism. However, as indicated in section 9.2, this is because Popper fails to conceive of the possibility of universalism, and is led as a result to defend a seriously irrational and undesirable conception of rational inquiry and civilization.
