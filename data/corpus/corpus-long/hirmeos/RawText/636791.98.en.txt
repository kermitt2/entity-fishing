Postulate 1B: At the first instant for which | A (t)| A (t) | 2 > 1- or | B (t)| B (t)| 2 > 1-, the state of the system collapses spontaneously into  A (t) with probability |c A | 2 , or into  B (t) with probability |c B | 2 ,  being a universal constant, a positive real number very nearly equal tozero.Here, m a , m b and m c are the masses of "particles" a, b and c respectively, and ==h/2 where h is Planck's constant. The condition for probabilistic collapse, formulated above, can readily be generalized to apply to more complicated and realistic inelastic interactions between "particles".

According to the micro-realistic, fundamentally probabilistic version of quantum theory, indicated above, the state function, (t), describes the actual physical state of the quantum system, from moment to moment. Quantum systems may be called "propensitons". The physical (quantum) state of the propensiton evolves in accordance with Schrödinger's time-dependent equation as long as the condition for a probabilistic transition to occur does not obtain. The moment it does obtain, the state jumps instantaneously and probabilistically, in the manner indicated above, into a new state. (All but one of a superposition of states, each with distinct "particles" associated with them, vanish.) The new state then continues to evolve in accordance with Schrödinger's equation until conditions for a new probabilistic transitionnarise.

Propensiton quantum theory (PQT), as we may call this micro-realistic, fundamentally probabilistic version of quantum theory, can recover all the experimental success of OQT. This follows from four points. First, OQT and PQT use the same dynamical equation, namely Schrödinger's timedependent equation. Second, whenever a position measurement is made, and a quantum system is detected, this invariably involves the creation of a new "particle" (bound or stationary system, such as the ionization of an atom or the dissociation of a molecule, usually millions of these). This means that whenever a position measurement is made, the conditions for probabilistic transitions to occur, according to PQT, are satisfied. PQT will reproduce the predictions of OQT (given that PQT is provided with a specification of the quantum state of the measuring apparatus). Third, all other observables of OQT, such as momentum, energy, angular momentum or spin, always involve (i) a preparation procedure which leads to distinct spatial locations being associated with distinct values of the observable to be measured, and (ii) a position measurement in one or other spatial location. This means that PQT can predict the outcome of measurements of all the observables of OQT. Fourth, in so far as the predictions of OQT and PQT dier, the dierence is extraordinarily dicult to detect, and will not be detectable in any quantum measurement so far performed.

In principle, however, OQT and PQT yield predictions that diier for experiments that are extraordinarily diicult to perform, and which have not yet, to my knowledge, been performed. Consider the following evolution:

Suppose the experimental arrangement is such that, if the superposition at stage (3) persists, then interference effects will be detected at stage (5). Suppose, now, that at stage (3) the condition for the superposition to collapse into one or other state, according to PQT, obtains. In these circumstances, OQT predicts interference at stage (5), whereas PQT predicts no interference at stage (5) (assuming the above evolution is repeated many times). PQT predicts that in each individual case, at stage (3), the superposition collapses probabilistically into one or other state. Hence there can be no interference.

8.3 Further questions

It may be asked how (t) can possibly represent the real physical state of a quantum system given that (t) is a complex function of space and time. The answer is that (t) can always be construed to depict two real functions of space and time.

It may be asked how (t) can possibly represent the real physical state of a quantum system consisting of two (or more) quantum entangled "particles", since in this case (t) is a function of six-dimensional configuration space plus time (or, in general, a function of 3N configuration space plus time, where N is the number of quantum entangled "particles" that go to make up the system in question). In the case of two "particles", we can construe (r 1 , r 2 , t), where r 1 and r 2 are the spatial coordinates of "particles" 1 and 2 respectively, as depicting the propensity state of the system in real 3-dimensional physical space, as follows. |(r 1 , r 2 , t)| 2 dV 1 dV 2 represents the probability of the system interacting in a localizing (wave-packet-collapsing) way such that "particle" 1 interacts in volume element dV 1 about spatial coordinates r 1 , and "particle" 2 interacts in volume element dV 2 about spatial coordinates r 2. The quantum entangled nature of the system means that as r 2 is changed, so the probability of "particle" 1 interacting in dV 1 about r 2 will, in general, change too.
