None of the above, however, captures that feature of present-day scientific, academic inquiry which constitutes the most blatant and harmful institutional embodiment of specialism. This feature concerns, not so much the internal intellectual-institutional structure of scientific, academic inquiry, but rather the way in which scientific, academic inquiry is related to society, to life, and to the problem solving that goes on in all our personal and social lives. According to the version of universalism that I wish to defend, the basic task of professional scientific, academic inquiry is to help all of us to recognize and resolve rationally those problems we need to resolve in order to discover and achieve that which is most desirable and of value in life. The basic task of critical fundamentalist academic inquiry is to help us to put universalism into practice in our personal, social lives, and to help us to develop a social order, a world, in which cooperative rational resolving of our most important personal and social life-problems may receive every encouragement. For this goal to be realized, there must be a constant two-way flow of ideas and arguments between discussion of fundamental problems in society, as a part of life, and discussion of fundamental problems within professional scientific, academic inquiry. An intimate, two-way, rational relationship needs to exist between society and science, life and scholarship.

At present this vital rational sociocultural relationship scarcely exists anywhere. This is largely due to the prevalence of specialism, which prohibits the above rational social relationship. Specialism demands precisely that scientific, academic inquiry, in order to be intellectually rigorous, must be such that the intellectual domain of scientific, academic inquiry is decisively dissociated from the discussion of problems that goes on in society, as a part of life. Scientists and academics, upholding specialist intellectual standards, have done their utmost to develop and preserve this dissociation-in order, from their own standpoint, to preserve rigorous intellectual standards. As a result, the scientific, academic community has betrayed its most profound intellectual purpose (as seen from the perspective of universalism): to help us develop more rational, wiser ways of living, a more rational, wiser world. The result of this betrayal, not surprisingly, is that the production of specialist knowledge flourishes, while wisdom in life, worldwide wisdom, falters.Of the two views under consideration, it is universalism, and not specialism, which provides us with a rational, intellectually rigorous conception of intellectual inquiry.

In assessing the relative merits of the competing doctrines of universalism and specialism, it is vital to recognize that universalism fully acknowledges the immense value of-indeed the absolute necessity for-specialized scientific, academic work and thought. It is often only by putting into practice the two basic rules of rational problem solving (c) and (d), formulated above in section 9.2, that it is possible to make any headway with improving our solutions to our fundamental problems. Specialized problem solving, specialized scientific, academic work is absolutely essential, according to universalism, for rational problem solving in general.And of course most of the time it is quite specific, highly specialized versions of our four fundamental problems that we need to solve in any case-made quite specific to a time and place, a person or group of persons, a specific need or trouble. The decisive additional point insisted on by universalism is that it is absolutely essential to put into practice rules (a) and (b) too. There must be a sustained rational discussion of our common, fundamental problems both within the scientific, academic community and within society, intimately interconnected with specialized scientific, academic problem solving, if intellectual inquiry is to serve our best interests in a genuinely rigorous, rational fashion. It is legitimate, even desirable, that many individual scientists and scholars be absorbed by the pursuit of highly restricted, specialized topics and problems. What is vital is that the overall intellectual-institutional structure of scientific, academic inquiry, and of society itself, accords with the kind of hierarchical structure required by universalism-sustained, explicit attention being given to fundamental problems. Failure to put into practice-to institutionalize-this vital critical fundamentalist perspective must inevitably lead to the fragmentation and trivialization of intellectual inquiry, and to a general incapacity to tackle cooperatively and effectively mankind's fundamental problems. The institutionalizing of specialism, however, obliges us to neglect the critical fundamentalist perspective. As a result we cease to tackle rationally just those problems it is most important for us to tackle rationally. While diverse sub-problems may be brilliantly tackled, our most general and important problems fall into neglect.

The motivation for insisting that it is of the essence of rationality to articulate our basic problems, and to propose and criticize possible solutions, is really very simple. If we do this, we give ourselves the best chance of seeking to solve those subordinate problems which are relevant to our main objectives. If we do not do this, the chances are that we will become engaged in seeking to solve sub-problems which are entirely misconceived or wholly irrelevant from the standpoint of achieving our basic objectives. Putting specialism into practice, in other words, is almost bound to lead to a mass of problem-solving activity which is misconceived or irrelevant from the standpoint of what matters most in lifea fair comment, I suggest, on a great deal of scientific, academic inquiry as pursued at present.
