The evidence for *q in final position is extremely limited. One possible example is 'smoke', whose correspondences are similar to those for medial *q (Kaera banax and Wersing punak). However, the Teiwa, Nedebang, and Western Pantar reflexes are zero. Another candidate correspondence is 'rice': Western Pantar ala and Klon, Kui, Wersing arak, which compares to Teiwa qar, Nedebang qara, and Kaera (na)xar. If the Teiwa, Nedebang, and Kaera forms are interpreted as a result of metathesis of *r and *q, then this correspondence could also support *q in final position, namely, *araq. However, we find insufficient evidence to support reconstruction of *q in final position.

2.3 Fricatives

We reconstruct two fricatives to pAP, *s and *h. While *s occurs freely in all positions, the glottal fricative *h is restricted to initial position. Correspondence sets for *s are relatively straightforward. In initial position *s weakens to h in Adang, and Klon, and strengthens to t in Abui, Sawila, and Wersing. In the remaining languages, which include all four Pantar languages in addition to

The reconstruction of *h is supported by its presence in Western Pantar and Teiwa. The remaining languages lose original *h, though Blagar, Adang, and Klon have h < *s, and Abui has h < *g. Proto-Alor-Pantar *h did not occur in non-initial position. While *h is consistently retained in Western Pantar, Teiwa actually has 63 two reflexes of *h, the glottal fricative h and the pharyngeal fricative . This is due to a phonemic split in Teiwa, resulting from an original conditioned distribution where  occurred only before back vowels, and h occurred elsewhere. Modern Teiwa still tends this way, with the pharyngeal fricative generally occurring before back vowels and the glottal fricative preceding front vowels.lists only one example of a pharyngeal fricative preceding a front vowel, namely er 'yell, shout, chant, cry aloud'. This form is cognate with Western Pantar hora, suggesting that the original form may have contained a back vowel, thus conditioning the Teiwa pharyngeal. This distinction breaks down, however, before low vowels, where a clear synchronic phonemic distinction has developed in Teiwa, as in haan 'village' (< *haban) vs. a 'fish' (< *habi).

There is a regular and unchanging correspondence of initial and medial /m/ across all the AP languages. As with the stops, *m is reflected as a geminate in medial position in Western Pantar. Correspondence sets reflecting initial and medial *m include 'come', 'betel vine', 'sit', '(be) in/on', 'fat', 'bedbug', 'horn', 'thatch', 'thick', 'walk 1 ', and 'breast'. The reconstruction of pAP initial *m is thus secure and supported by multiple cognate sets. In medial position subsequent developments may result in nasal-final forms which obey language-specific constraints. For example, Western Pantar does not admit final nasals other than velars, hence Western Pantar ha 'breast' results from later apocope, namely, pAP

Final *m is retained as m in six of the twelve languages, but only in Teiwa and Kaera does it occur in final position. Blagar and Adang have a velar nasal reflex, while Klon and Kui have an alveolar nasal reflex (Kui talama 'six' is likely a borrowing from Abui). For many of the languages, forms reflecting final *m have an epenthetic final vowel, so that the reflex of original final *m is no longer in final position. Thus, Abui talama < *talam 'six', tama < *tam 'saltwater'. Correspondence sets reflecting final *m include 'father', 'nose', 'six', and 'saltwater'. Evidence from 'saltwater' weakly supports positing the loss of final *m in Nedebang.

The behavior of the alveolar nasal mirrors that of the labial nasal in initial and medial position. Proto-Alor-Pantar *n is retained in all languages and is geminated in medial position in Western Pantar. Correspondence sets supporting initial and medial *n include 'one', 1sg, 'eat/drink', 'smoke', 'black' 'hold', 'give', 'die', 'ripe', and 'name'. Thus, pAP *nai 'eat/drink' > Teiwa, Kaera, Western Pantar, Blagar, Adang na, Nedebang ina, Klon na, Kui, Wersing nai, Abui, Sawila ne, Kamang ne.

2 The internal history of the Alor-Pantar language family Final *n is reflected as a velar nasal in all languages except Teiwa, Klon, and Kui, where it is retained as n. The correspondence sets 'five', 'hand/arm', 'thatch', and 'fingernail' show irregularities in reflexes of final *n, perhaps due to borrowing. Nedebang jisin 'five' has a final alveolar rather than the expected velar and is likely borrowed from neighboring Teiwa jusan, while Kaera has isim 'five' with a final labial nasal, possibly due to influence from the following tiam 'six' when counting. The correspondence set for 'fingernail' is more problematic. Abui kusi has the velar nasal as expected but shows an irregular reflex of medial *s. Western Pantar kusi and Klon kuh show irregular loss of the final nasal.
