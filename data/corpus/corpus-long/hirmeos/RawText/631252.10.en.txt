While we can identify regular correspondence sets supporting *r, this phoneme occurs in complementary distribution with *j. In fact, *r is the only consonant which does not occur in initial position (seebelow). In contrast, glides *j and *w occur only in initial position; final glides in the modern languages derive from original vowels. The complementary distribution of *r and *j raises the possibility that *r is actually an allophone of *j in pAP. However, the /r/  51 Gary Holton & Laura C. Robinson

/l/ distinction is found in all of the modern AP languages (seebelow), and at least two liquids must be reconstructed to proto-Timor-Alor-Pantar, the immediate parent of pAP (see Chapter 3). Although a uvular stop is found in only two of the modern AP languages, the reconstruction of pAP *q is well-supported by a number of correspondence sets. In addition to Teiwa and Nedebang, which maintain *q as /q/, in Kaera the reflex of *q is /x/, which is distinct from the reflex of *k as /k/. Western Pantar collapses *q and *k as /k/ in initial position but maintains the distinction in medial position, as only the reflex of *k is geminate. Outside these four Pantar languages, the *q/*k distinction is lost. From a typological perspective the presence of the uvular stop is highly unusual. Only 2.4% of the languages insurvey of consonant inventories contain uvular stops, though two of those languages are Trans-New Guinea (This figure is consistent withsurvey of the phonological systems of 71 languages of East Nusantara. Hajek identifies only one language other than Teiwa which contrasts velar and uvular stops; this is the West Papuan language Tehit.

The inventory of pAP consonants is very similar to that found in many of the modern Alor-Pantar languages, and its size is typical for the East Nusantara region). Most modern AP languages differ in having a velar nasal, which is not reconstructed for pAP. As noted above most AP languages also distinguish /r/ and /l/. The consonant inventory for pAP can be compared with that for the modern language Western Pantar in

The Western Pantar inventory exhibits several features typical of phonological developments in the modern languages. First, the uvular stop has merged with the velar stop. Second, Western Pantar has developed a velar nasal in final position. Third, Western Pantar has developed a phonemic glottal stop. The distributional restrictions on pAP consonants are summarized inIt should be noted that while *g does occur in initial position, it occurs there only in pronominal forms. 52 2 The internal history of the Alor-Pantar language family, we reconstruct the voiced stops *b and *d for all positions, but after revising the reconstructions based on external data from Timor (see Chapter 3), many reconstructions which formerly ended in a voiced stop have now been revised to include further segments (i.e., 'fire', 'fish', 'sugarcane', 'sun', 'throw'). The voiced stops *b and *d are now only weakly attested in final position in our data, and it is possible that with further evidence, those few reconstructions with final *b and *d may need to be revised as well. Note that we also do not reconstruct *g in final position, so pAP may have had a restriction on final voiced stops, though these do occur in modern AP languages (e.g., Teiwa liag and Kaera leg 'rattan').

The lack of final *p is robustly evidenced in our data. All instances of final p in the modern languages can be traced to either an original medial *p or to *b, as in Teiwa tap < *tapai 'pierce', or Western Pantar hap < *habi 'fish'.

Drawing from a comparative lexical database consisting of approximately 400 items we identify 129 cognate sets reflecting regular sound correspondences (see Appendix). There are only 127 distinct meanings, as two of the meanings, 'dog' and 'walk', are found in more than one cognate set. These forms show predominantly regular sound correspondences, as described below. However, it is important to note that several of the cognate sets cannot be reconstructed to pAP, since they are found only in a geographically restricted area. That is, in some cases lexemes appear to have been innovated. This is particularly obvious for those meanings for which we have two correspondence sets (distinguished below with subscript numerals). The supporting data for each of these sets is provided in the course of demonstrating the correspondences in the following subsections. The complete set of correspondences can be found in the Appendix.

In this section we describe the 35 consonant correspondences which we have identified in our sample of AP languages. In most cases the correspondences are conditioned by environment; we thus provide examples of the correspondences in word-initial, word-medial, and word-final position. The tables below set out the consonant correspondences, as well as the reconstructed pAP phoneme for each correspondence set. The environment (Env) column indicates whether the correspondence applies in initial (#__ ), medial (V__V), or final ( __#) position. A zero (Ã˜) in a column indicates that the pAP sound in question is lost in that language. A dash (-) in a column indicates that we lack sufficient data to posit a reflex for that language. A slash ( / ) indicates that more than one reflex is found in that language.
