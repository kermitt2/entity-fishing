1.9 The basic argument running through Popper's early work

It is important to appreciate the existence of a central backbone of argument running through these four books. In L.Sc.D., as we have seen, Popper argues that all scientific knowledge is irredeemably conjectural in character, it being impossible to verify theories empirically. Science makes progress by proposing bold conjectures in response to problems, which are then subjected to sustained attempted empirical refutation. This falsificationist conception of scientific method is then generalized to form Popper's conception of (critical) rationality, a general methodology for solving problems or making progress. As Popper puts it in L.Sc.D.: "inter-subjective testing is merely a very important aspect of the more general idea of inter-subjective criticism, or in other words, of the idea of mutual rational control by critical discussion", note 1*). But in order to make sense of the idea of severe testing in science, we need to see the experimentalist as having at least the germ of an idea for a rival theory up his sleeve (otherwise testing might degenerate into performing essentially the same experiment again and again). This means experiments are always crucial experiments, attempts at trying to decide between two competing theories. Theoretical pluralism is necessary for science to be genuinely empirical. And, more generally, in order to criticize an idea, one needs to have a rival idea in mind. Rationality, as construed by Popper, requires plurality of ideas, values, ways of life. Thus, for Popper, the rational society is the open society.

Given pre-Popperian conceptions of reason, with their emphasis on proof rather than criticism (and associated plurality of ideas), the idea that the rational society is the open society is almost a contradiction in terms. There is thus a very close link between L.Sc.D., on the one hand, and O.S.E., P.H. and C.R. on the other. And the direction of argument does not go in just one direction, from L.Sc.D. to O.S.E.: it goes in the other direction as well., Popper argues that rationality, and scientific rationality as well, need to be conceived of in social and institutional terms (and the argument is echoed in P.H., in connection with a discussion about the conditions required for scientific progress to be possible). O.S.E., P.H. and C.R. illuminate and enrich the doctrines of L.Sc.D.

Above, in connection with the discussion of L.Sc.D., it was argued that Popper's falsificationism ultimately fails, because of its failure to exclude highly falsifiable but grossly ad hoc theories from science. The scientific enterprise is obliged to conjecture that the universe is more or less comprehensible, having some kind of unified dynamic structure, only those theories being tentatively accepted which satisfy (a) empirical considerations, and (b) considerations having to do with simplicity, unity, comprehensibility. As science proceeds, we improve our (conjectural) knowledge of the kind of comprehensible unity which may exist in nature; the aim of science improves, and with it the methods of science. There is, in other words, a kind of positive feedback between improving knowledge and improving aims and methods, improving knowledge about how to improve knowledge. Science adapts its nature to what it finds out about the nature of the universe (which helps to account for the almost explosive growth of scientific knowledge).

This "evolving-aims-and-methods" view of science modifies quite considerably Popper's falsificationism. When generalized, it leads to an "evolving-aims-and-methods" view of rationality which in turn modifies quite considerably Popper's critical rationalism. These modifications, if adopted, have far-reaching implications for central doctrines of Popper's L.Sc.D., O.S.E., P.H. and C.R. (see

1.10 Popper's later work

Work published by Popper after C.R., though containing much of great value, is not, perhaps, in quite the same league as that of his first four books. Much of this work restates, extends and further applies earlier ideas. Where Popper's subsequent work launches forth in new directions, these are not always well chosen. Battles against subjectivity, antirealism and physical determinism lure Popper into defending opposing views that are exaggerated, sometimes, almost to the point of absurdity. A subtle shift of perspective, of allegiance, can be discerned as we move from Popper's earlier to his later work. In his early work, Popper speaks up on behalf of humanity, on behalf of any concerned person of good will, and against those traditional "great thinkers" and "experts" who threaten to beguile us and lead us to disaster. In his later work, the allegiances have shifted; now Popper speaks up on behalf of great science and great scientists, and against fraudulent academics, mostly philosophers and social scientists.
