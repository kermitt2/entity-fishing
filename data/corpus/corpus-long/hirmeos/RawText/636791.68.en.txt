, in that each of T 1 etc. asserts that nature is disunified, whereas physicalism(8) asserts that it is unified. This might seem to make a nonsense of the idea that T 1 , T 2 ,  T n is moving steadily and progressively towards some future T n+r which is a precise, testable version of physicalismBut what section 5.3 shows is that, even though all of T 1 , T 2 ,  T n are incompatible with physicalism(8), because they are disunified, nevertheless a precise meaning can be given to the assertion that T r+1 is closer to physicalism, or more unified, than T r. This is the case if T r+1 is (a) of greater empirical content than T r (since these are candidate theories of everything), and (b) of a higher degree of unity than T r in ways specified in section 5.3. Thus the account of unity given above, involving physicalism(1-8), gives precision to the idea that a succession of false theories, T 1,  T n , all of which contradict physicalism(8), nevertheless can be construed as moving ever closer to the goal of specifying physicalism(8) as a precise, testable, physical theory of everything.

5.6 Metaphysical minimalism

I turn now to the argument designed to show that that version of physicalism should be accepted which is the weakest available which just suffices to exclude theories more disunified than currently accepted physical theories-at present the standard model (SM) and general relativity (GR). We may take this to be the strongest version of physicalism that is compatible with SM+GR. This, it may be argued, leads to physicalism(n = 3) being accepted-or possibly physicalism(n = 4, N = 4), where N = 4 does justice to the fact that SM+GR includes four distinct forces, electromagnetism, the weak and strong forces, and gravitation (electromagnetism and the weak force being only partially unified in quantum electroweak theory).

But physicalism(n = 3) is, it may be argued, much too strong. It assumes that SM+GR is consistent. Quantum field theory ordinarily assumes flat Minkowskian space-time, but it can be extended to apply in the curved space-time of GR. Problems arise, however, when attempts are made to treat quantum mechanically described matter or energy as the source of gravitation, and so of the curvature of space-time, according to GR. No version of SM+GR can be applied satisfactorily to the interior of black holes. Insuperable problems arise if one tries to incorporate the quantum measurement of orthodox quantum theory into the framework of GR. SM+GR is, it seems, not a consistent theory. Even GR on its own faces a problem of consistency, in that GR predicts that a singularity forms inside a black hole, which constitutes a breakdown of the continuity of space-time, and thus a kind of inconsistency of the theory. In order to assess the degree of disunity of SM+GR one has to consider a version patched up in an ad hoc way so as to create a theory that is at least consistent. Such an ad hoc patching up will further increase the kind and degree of disunity of the theory.

There is a further point. Orthodox quantum theory (OQT) holds that electrons, atoms, even molecules can be in superpositions of statesat different spatial locations at the same time, for example-whereas macroscopic measuring instruments cannot (measuring instruments detecting one outcome and not a superposition of outcomes). This means OQT holds that different laws hold at different levels-different masses, levels of complexity or whatever it may be. This in turn means that OQT is disunified in way n = 2. Physicalism(n=2, N=2) is perhaps compatible with OQT, but any more unified version of physicalism is not. This is a very serious level of disunity. What makes the matter even worse is that OQT does not specify what variables are involved-let alone what value of what variables-in the transition from quantum states and superpositions to classical states without such superpositions.5.7 The hierarchical view

Should physics accept physicalism(8) in line with the argument of section 5.5, and risk committing physics to a highly specific and contentful version of physicalism all too likely to be false, despite its fruitfulness for physics up to the present? Or should physics accept some clumsy version of physicalism indicated in section 5.6, less contentful and thus more likely to be true, but entirely lacking in fruitful guidelines for the development of new physical theories?

No version of presuppositionism which restricts itself to adopting a single (if composite) metaphysical thesis can satisfactorily resolve the conflicting desiderata that are highlighted in these two questions. But this conflict is resolved if we adopt a version of presuppositionism which holds that we need to see physics as adopting a hierarchy of theses, from physicalism(8) near the bottom of the hierarchy to physicalism(1) at the top (see1). Physicalism(5-7) are on the same level since they are all but equivalent to one another. As we descend the hierarchy, from level (9) to level (3), theses become increasingly contentful and specific, increasingly potentially fruitful for future progress in theoretical physics but also increasingly likely to be false and in need of revision. As one moves from level (9) to level (3), the corresponding methodological requirements for unity, depicted as sloping dotted lines in
