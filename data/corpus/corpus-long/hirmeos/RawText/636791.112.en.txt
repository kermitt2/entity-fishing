Just this critical fundamentalist conception of scienceexemplifying elementary rules of rational problem solving-is, however, rejected absolutely by almost all contemporary scientists and philosophers of science. For, according to traditional empiricist conceptions of science-almost universally taken for granted within the scientific community-it is the essential, defining characteristic of science that scientific theories are selected impartially with respect to empirical success, independently of their compatibility or incompatibility with comprehensive metaphysical assumptions about the nature of the world. Many, of course, acknowledge that simplicity considerations play an important role in the assessment of scientific theories in addition to empirical considerations (for example Mach, Duhem and Poincaré); the decisive point, however, is that biased preference for simple theories in science is not interpreted as committing science to the metaphysical, and possibly false, assumption that the universe itself is simple. According to this traditional empiricist standpoint, science is successful precisely because theories are selected impartially with respect to empirical considerations isolated from all a priori metaphysical assumptions about the nature of the world. This was one of Bacon's main points. (Descartes disagreed; but with the downfall of Cartesian science, and the success of Newtonian science, generally and wrongly held to incorporate Baconian inductivism, Cartesian universalism was rejected by the scientific community.) The diverse philosophies of science of inductivism (Bacon and Mill), conventionalism (Duhem and Poincaré) and logical empiricism (Carnap, Hempel and Nagel) all take for granted that in science theories are selected with respect to empirical success alone, unbiased by metaphysical assumptions about the nature of the universe as a whole. Even those thinkers who acknowledge the importance of a priori metaphysical ideas (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant) miss the essential point of the critical fundamentalist conception of science outlined above. For instead of emphasizing that our fundamental metaphysical ideas about the nature of the universe are conjectures, more or less bound to be false, and therefore needing constant critical scrutiny and development within science, these thinkers, on the contrary, seek to show, in one way or another, that fundamental metaphysical assumptions or principles can be conclusively established by reason, by argument. In effect empiricists and so-called "rationalists" agree on one main point: metaphysical principles, unverifiable by experience, have a legitimate place in science only if they can be conclusively established by reason. Rationalists defend the existence of such principles; empiricists, correctly, reject this possibility. Both parties miss the essential point: metaphysical principles play a decisive role in science; these principles are, however, conjectures, more or less bound to be false. Hence, if science is to be rational, it is essential that these principles be articulated, criticized and developed as an integral part of the scientific enterprise. Even Russell, it should be noted, misses this point.recognizes that scientific method implicitly makes substantial metaphysical presuppositions about the world; he fails, however, to draw the critical fundamentalist conclusion from this, namely that a genuinely rational science seeks to improve its metaphysical presuppositions, and its methods, as it progresses.The point is decisively rejected even by Popper. Popper has many critical fundamentalist arguments and remarks to his credit. His book The Open Society and Its Enemies (1966a) tackles an issue central to universalism. Popper emphasizes that metaphysical ideas have often played a highly fruitful role in scienceHe has emphasized the importance of "metaphysical research programmes" for science, some science, in his view, even amounting to metaphysical research programmes (for example, in his view, the theory of natural selection) (1976a, pp. 148-51, and sections 33 and 37).He has argued that metaphysical ideas can be assessed rationally, as more or less adequate, tentative solutions to problemsHe has stressed that intellectual inquiry needs to be organized, not in terms of subject matter and disciplines, but rather in terms of problems and attempts to solve problemsHe has emphasized that science at its best is cosmology-the attempt, in effect, to answer the question "What kind of world is this?"He has argued for philosophy conceived as a part of our attempt to improve our knowledge and understanding of the world, and against the view that philosophy is merely specialized "puzzle solving", or conceptual analysis). Finally, he has explicitly condemned specialism. Thus, commenting on the attitude of mind of the normal scientist, as described by Kuhn, Popper remarks: I admit that this kind of attitude exists: and it exists not only among engineers, but among people trained as scientists. I can only say that I see a great danger in it and in the possibility of its becoming normal (just as I see a great danger in the increase of specialization, which also is an undeniable historical fact): a danger to science and, indeed, to our civilization.Elsewhere, as I have already noted, he remarks:

If the many, the specialists, gain the day, it will be the end of science as we know it-of great science. It will be a spiritual catastrophe comparable in its consequences to nuclear armament.
