According to Kuhn, successful revolutions mark radical discontinuities in the advancement of science, to the extent, indeed, that old and new paradigms are "incommensurable" (i.e. so different that they cannot be compared). This Kuhnian view is most likely to be correct when applied to revolutions in fundamental theoretical physics, where radical discontinuity seems most marked. But it is precisely here that Kuhn's claim turns out to be seriously inadequate. As I have already emphasized, all revolutions in theoretical physics, despite their diversity in other respects, reveal one common theme: they are all gigantic steps in unification. From Newton, via Maxwell, Einstein, Bohr, Schr√∂dinger and Dirac, to Salam, Weinberg and Gell-Mann, all new revolutionary theories in physics bring greater unity to physics. (And Darwinian theory, one might add, brings a kind of unity to the whole of biology.) The very phenomenon that Kuhn holds to mark discontinuity, namely revolution, actually also reveals continuity-continuity of the search for, and the successful discovery of, underlying theoretical unity.This aspect of natural science, to which Kuhn fails entirely to do justice, is especially emphasized by AOE. According to AOE, revolutions in theoretical physics mark discontinuity at the level of theory, at level 2, and even discontinuity at level 3, but continuity at level 4. Physicalism, which asserts that underlying dynamic unity exists in nature, persists through revolutions-or, at least, has persisted through all revolutions in physics since Galileo. In order to make rational sense of natural science, we need to interpret the whole enterprise as seeking to turn physicalism, the assertion of underlying dynamic unity in nature,into a precise, unified, testable, physical "theory of everything". That, in a sentence, is what AOE asserts. Physicalism, according to AOE, despite its metaphysical (untestable) character, is the most secure item of theoretical knowledge in science; it is the most fruitful idea that science has come up with, at that level in the hierarchy of assumptions.

Because of its recognition that, despite the discontinuity of revolutions at levels 2 and 3, there is the continuity of the persistence of physicalism at level 4 (and of other theses at levels higher up in the hierarchy), AOE is able to resolve problems concerning the discovery and assessment of paradigms which Kuhn's view is quite unable to solve. Both fundamental physical theories and level 3 blueprints can be partially ordered with respect to how well they exemplify physicalism, entirely independent of ordinary empirical assessment. Assessing progress through revolution poses no problem for AOE. As we have seen, AOE solves the problem of verisimilitude.

I have already mentioned that AOE does not merely describe scientific practice; it carries implications as to how scientific practice can be improved. One such implication concerns scientific revolutions.gives a brilliant description of the way, during a scientific revolution, there is a breakdown of rationality, competing arguments for the rival paradigms being circular, and each presupposing what is being argued for. This is a feature of actual science. Scientists do not know how to assess competing theories objectively when empirical considerations are inconclusive. But all this can be seen to be a direct consequence of trying to do science without the explicit acknowledgement of persisting metaphysical assumptions concerning the comprehensibility of the universe, there thus being nothing available to constrain acceptance of theories when empirical considerations are inconclusive. Consider Kuhn's breakdown of rationality. A substantial revolution will involve, not just two rival paradigms or theories, T 1 and T 2 , but two rival blueprints, B 1 lurking behind T 1 , and B 2 lurking behind T 2. Granted B 1 , T 1 is far more acceptable than T 2 , but the reverse holds granted B 2. But B 1 and B 2 , being untestable, metaphysical theses, they are not explicitly discussable, and objectively assessable, within science; so they are more or less repressed, excluded from discussion. Nevertheless, scientists do think in terms of B 1 and B 2. Kuhn's Gestalt switch, involved in switching allegiance from T 1 to T 2 , can be pinpointed as the act of abandoning the old blueprint and adopting the new one. Non-empirical arguments in favour of T 1 or T 2 can only take the form of an appeal to B 1 or B 2 , in however a muffled a way (due to the point that blueprints are not open to explicit discussion). Such arguments will be circular, and entirely unconvincing to the opposition, in just the way described by Kuhn. Accept B 1 , and T 1 becomes the only possible choice; accept B 2 and T 2 is the only choice. Each side in the dispute is convinced that the other side is wrong, even incoherent. What needs to be done, and cannot be done, of course, is to discuss the relative merits of B 1 and B 2. Just this can be done, granted AOE. T 1 , B 1 , T 2 and B 2 can all be assessed from the standpoint of adequacy in exemplifying physicalism. When the scientific community adopts AOE, the Kuhnian irrationality of revolutions will disappear from science.
