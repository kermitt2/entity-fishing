(ii) Meta-knowability is too good a possibility, from the standpoint of the growth of knowledge, not to be accepted initially, the idea only being reluctantly abandoned if all attempts at improving methods for the improvement of knowledge fail.

(i) and (ii) are not, perhaps, very strong grounds for accepting meta-knowability; both are open to criticism. But the crucial point, for the present argument, is that these grounds for accepting meta-knowability, (i) and (ii), are independent of the success of science. This suffices to avoid circularity.But what about reasons for accepting theses at levels 5, 4 and 3? Are not these inevitably viciously circular? The thesis that the universe is comprehensible, at level 5, is accepted because no other idea, compatible with meta-knowability, has been so fruitful in generating empirically progressive research programmes; the thesis that the universe is physically comprehensible, at level 4, is accepted because no other thesis, compatible with the level 5 thesis, has been so fruitful in generating empirically progressive research programmes;and likewise for the thesis at level 3. In short, theories at level 2 are accepted because of empirical success and compatibility with level 3, 4 or 5 theses; and these theses are accepted because of their empirical fruitfulness. This would seem to be viciously circular in the most blatant fashion imaginable.

I have three arguments in refutation of this charge. First, there is no question of the truth of theories being justified by an appeal to metaphysical theses, the truth of which is in turn justified by the success of science, for the simple reason that AOE is thoroughly conjectural, and to that extent Popperian, in character, there being no attempt to justify the truth of either theories or metaphysical theses.

Second, physicalism is incompatible with accepted fundamental physical theories, so there could be no question of the truth of one being justified by an appeal to the truth of the other. Physicalism is deployed to criticize, and to try to improve, accepted fundamental theories, not to justify their truth.

Third, and decisively, in so far as acceptance of physical theories is in part justified by an appeal to physicalism, whose acceptance is in turn justified by an appeal to the (apparent) success of science, which does involve a kind of circularity, this is licensed and legitimized by the level 6 thesis of meta-knowability. This asserts that the universe is such that there is some rationally discoverable thesis which, if accepted, makes possible the progressive improvement of more specific assumptions and methods in the light of the empirical success and failure of the research programmes to which they give rise. If meta-knowability is true, then progressively improving more specific metaphysical assumptions in the light of which seem to lead to the greatest empirical success, while at the same time choosing those empirically successful theories which best accord with these metaphysical assumptions, is just what needs to be done to make scientific progress. Meta-knowability, if true, justifies the element of circularity that is involved.

The gross invalidity of the genuinely viciously circular argument can be highlighted as follows. The argument seeks to justify acceptance of theory T by an appeal to metaphysical thesis M, and then justify acceptance of M by an appeal to the empirical success of T. But this argument works just as well (or ill) if we choose some empirically successful but horribly ad hoc rival to T, say T*, and a suitably ad hoc variant of M, say M*. We can now argue, with equal validity (i.e. none) that we justify acceptance of T* by appealing to M*, and justify acceptance of M* by appealing to the empirical success of T*. We have here a way of testing whether or not a putative solution to the problem of induction is, or is not, viciously circular: it must provide some valid way of ruling out arguments that appeal to ad hoc theories and theses like T* and M*. AOE, granted the level 6 thesis of meta-knowability, does provide this. Given that M accords with meta-knowability in being rationally discoverable, all ad hoc rivals of M (i.e. M*) are ruled out because these are not "rationally discoverable": M* is just one of infinitely many equally viable theses. Thus, if meta-knowability is accepted, AOE is not viciously circular-not circular in any invalid sense. Meta-knowability in effect asserts that the universe is such that no ad hoc or aberrant version of argumentation which appeals to T and M-a version which appeals to some T* and M*-can meet with success, because all M*-type metaphysical theses are false.

It is of course absolutely vital that arguments for accepting metaknowability do not themselves appeal to the success of science (for this would simply reintroduce vicious circularity at a higher level). The argument given above for accepting meta-knowability is weak, but it does not appeal, in any way whatsoever, to the success of science. Thus AOE is free of vicious circularity.
