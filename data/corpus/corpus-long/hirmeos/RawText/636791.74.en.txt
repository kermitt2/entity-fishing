How, then, does the scientific community decide which of these very many different kinds of properties of theories are the relevant or important ones to employ in order to assess the acceptability of theories on non-empirical, or aesthetic, grounds? And what is the justification for so assessing theories, in terms of the preferred properties? How, in particular, can MAI do justice to the fact that aesthetic criteria in science change over time?

The answer is that, at any given stage, a scientific community prefers those new theories that have properties which earlier theories, which have proved to be empirically successful, also possess. If a certain kind of theory, with characteristic aesthetic properties, has met with empirical success in the past then, understandably enough, scientists are influenced to give preference to similar kinds of theories, with similar properties, in the future. This is "the aesthetic induction". At a stroke, the above three questions are answered.

In a little more detail, we can imagine that a scientific community can consider many different aesthetic properties of theories, P, Q, R, . The community will assign a different weighting, W P , W Q , W R ,  to each of these properties, each weighting determining how influential the corresponding property is in theory choice. The weightings are in turn determined by what kinds of theory, with what properties, have (or have not) met with empirical success in the past. W P , W Q , W R ,  are, in other words, determined by the aesthetic induction.

According to MAI, then, two kinds of criteria are employed in science to choose theories. On the one hand there are criteria, listed above, arrived at by analysis of the basic aim of science of achieving empirical adequacy. And, on the other hand, there are criteria arrived at by the aesthetic induction. The second presupposes the first. Aesthetic criteria will tend to be conservative, based as they are on empirical performance of theories in the past. New theories, with the potential for great predictive success, may violate existing, conservative aesthetic criteria. When such a theory is developed, there is a rupture in accepted aesthetic criteria. Initially the new theory is judged to be "ugly"; but as its empirical potential becomes manifest, aesthetic criteria are changed to suit the new theory. This is what a scientific revolution amounts to, according to MAI, a conception somewhat different from Kuhn's. In terms of this conception, neither Copernicus's theory, nor Einstein's theory of special relativity, were revolutionary, because neither broke with aesthetic criteria of the past. But Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and quantum theory, were both revolutionary, in that these theories broke dramatically with aesthetic criteria generally accepted at the time.

Finally, though the aesthetic induction might one day favour some particular metaphysical world view, so far this has not happened

6.3 Comparison of the two views

What is rather astonishing about aim-oriented empiricism (AOE) and MAI is that, though arrived at independently, and though giving what are, in some respects, very different pictures of the scientific enterprise, nevertheless the two views have much in common. Both seek to uphold what McAllister calls "the rationalist image of science". Both hold that (some) criteria of theory choice can be justified by an appeal to the aims of science. Both hold that non-empirical criteria of theory choice have an enormously important part to play in science. Both hold that these nonempirical criteria are, in practical applications, quite diverse in character. Both hold that they change over time, as science progresses. And there is considerable agreement as to what these non-empirical criteria are: simplicity, unity, symmetry and compatibility with some metaphysical world view, are all important, for both views.

Both hold that these criteria apply, not to specific formulations of theories, but to what all possible formulations have in common. And both give accounts of scientific revolutions that differ substantially from Kuhn's account.

But there are also dramatic differences. MAI is, for McAllister, "a medium-level model of scientific practice, of a scope intermediate between the loftiest generalization and the historical study"AOE is put forward as a "highest-level model", with implications and applications for all of natural science. (Strictly speaking, it is what I call "generalized AOE"embodying the hierarchical structure of AOE, but lacking specific, lower-level theses of AOE-that is a model at the highest level, applying to science throughout history; AOE is restricted to postGalilean science.)

Again, MAI is a version of standard empiricism (SE), whereas AOE emphatically rejects SE. That MAI is a version of SE is clear from the way the aim of science is characterized as "empirical adequacy". It is also apparent in the way science can, according to MAI, establish a metaphysical world view. This can only happen via the aesthetic induction, and has not as yet come about. According to AOE, by contrast, at levels 7 and 6 there are metaphysical, cosmological theses that are permanently accepted by science, and at levels 5 to 3, there are metaphysical theses which are a part of current scientific knowledge, but which are increasingly likely to require revision with the advance of science, as one descends from level 5 to level 3 (see
