The shape of education in the north is changing, although the underlying principles are not: 'schools are relatively new to many indigenous communities, but community responsibility for the education of the young is not'.And the impacts of a Western-based education system has left questions and problems surrounding the way that children are being taught. Zebedee Nungak, who was President of the Makivik Corporation in the 1990s as well as an important negotiator in the James Bay and North Québec Agreement (a land claims agreement signed in 1975 spanning much of northern Québec), speaks to this, comparing the current Nunavik education system to the failure of the Franklin expedition. He also emphasises the societal turmoil that came from such a dramatic shift in education from one generation to the next, asking the reader to 'consider that our grandparents, the first generation of Inuit to observe their grandchildren (us) being herded into uni-lingually English federal schools, were the last of countless previous generations to leave the nomadic lifestyle'.Education in the north was, in many cases, information passed down through generations, not something that was taught in a school: 'Inuit education did not traditionally comprise a separate set of practices, supervised and documented by an administrative body, this topic necessitated input from Elders who were raised and educated by their parents on the land'.With a shifting age demographic, as well as the boom of technology, the way that knowledge is being transmitted has also been impacted-not only the passing of knowledge, but also the culture and the society that depend on these relationships. Technology has a large role to play in how new generations are learning, and although the technology in the north may be slower than some southerners are used to, it still has an important role in the lives of newer generations. In today's society, the young can turn to Google instead of their elders and parents to learn the answers to some of the questions they have, and this will likely have a lasting impact on historical relationships built on learning and sharing of knowledge. The exact nature and magnitude of the impact this will have on communities in the north has yet to be determined, but one can be sure that it will shape the society of the next generations of Northerners, much as it will those living in the rest of Canada.

Russian Arctic

The place of the Arctic, and the north in general, in Russian history and national identity is punctuated with periods of heightened political interest and exploratory ventures. The populating of the Russian north began in earnest in the nineteenth century, while industrial development began in the 1930s-1940s and continued with the discovery of oil and gas in the 1960s-1980s. Seen from the south as a northern frontier, a resource bed of hydrocarbons and marine resources, a curse for convicts and a source of pride in the popular imaginary, the Russian Arctic defies a single definition. The Russian Arctic is also referred to by southerners in more abstract terms as 'a condition' of Northernness, 21 a geocultural non-place expressed linguistically through the concept of Russkiy Sever (the Russian North),or a socio-cultural entity defined as a vernacular mental cultural region.The ambiguous attitude of the Russians to their northern region is captured to an extent in the poll results of the Fond Obschestvennoye Mnenie (2015) which found that two-thirds of Russians support the state's policy of exploration in the Arctic; yet, the majority of the respondents to the poll expressed no desire to go there themselves.The politically-defined Russian Arctic, known as the 'Russian Arctic Zone', is generally described as a macroregion (which is defined in Federal Law on State Strategic Planning ofthat is, a special area of state governance implying similarity of economic and political interests (and naturally that of geographical conditions). Little affinity and lateral economic or political interactions between Arctic territorial units have been identified,while most of the resources required for regional development are being outsourced (from workforce to technologies to energy to food).The 'Russian Arctic' is often used, especially in International Relations studies, interchangeably with 'Russia' or 'Moscow' to indicate the Russian government.This implies subjugation and inseparability of the region from its metropole. While the term Russian Arctic Zone, used extensively in domestic political documents, is itself indicative of such centre-periphery relations and the supremacy of the government in representing and managing the Russian Arctic as a border region, there are indisputably more layers to the Russian Arctic (or any political region) that are often ignored 'to accommodate the story'.Political change

After the Arctic Strategywas issued, the heuristic parallels with the Soviet Union's industrialisation efforts were inevitable.Russian academics (e.g. A. Granberg, A. Tatarkin, A. Chilingarov) en masse supported Putin's undertakings, and some even insisted that there cannot be continuity between the Soviet Union and Russia, for the former's aggressive approach and reliance on convict labour is incompatible with the apparently liberal and democratic conditions of present-day Russia.Similarly, the institutional model of hypercentralisation adopted by the Soviet state and enacted through Glavsevmorput (semi-militarised 'fiefdom') and Dalstroi (industrial complex heavily reliant on convict labour)
