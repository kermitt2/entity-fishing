These amendments saw an insertion of animal welfare requirements into the indigenous exemption, but did not alter the way legitimate Arctic seal hunting is legally constructed in a European context. The text of the amended Basic Regulation in Article 3 ('Conditions for placing on the market') thus stipulates that seal products can be placed on the EU market when: (1) Seal products result from hunts conducted by Inuit or other indigenous communities; (2) There is a tradition of seal hunting in the community; (3) The hunt contributes to subsistence and income support yet without primarily commercial intent; and (4) The hunters pay due regard to animal welfare.In other words, the European Union is legally constructing limits for what Arctic seal hunts should be like in order to fall under the indigenous exemption of the EU Seal Regime. Special attention must be given to the notion of 'commercial seal hunts' in this context. The indigenous exemption does not allow seal hunts by indigenous peoples to be driven by commercial intent to yield products eligible for the European market. Although the exemption does refer to 'income to support life and sustainable livelihoods', 12 thus indicating the generation of money from the sale of seal products, the distinction between seal hunts for subsistence and commercial purposes is not easy to uphold.Moreover, not perceiving the Inuit as being embedded in modern economic systems neglects substantial in situ realities in the Inuit regions of the USA, Canada, Greenland and Russia.

As a result, Inuit and other groups have launched several court cases before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in order to overturn the ban. Although legally exempt from any trade barrier, the interlinked trade pathways of Inuit and non-Inuit seal products, the overall abstention of buyers from purchasing any seal products, and the market economic realities in Inuit communities led to drastic impacts on Inuit communities. Although being ultimately unsuccessful, the court cases demonstrate the empirical limitations, and arguably imagination-shaped character, of legal rules regarding Arctic economies and livelihoods.Arctic livelihoods as a legal construct

While the Arctic finds many reflections in international legal regimes, the focus of this chapter is 'Arcticness', a concept which this author understands to contribute to a better comprehension of what Arctic realities encompass. Many attempts have been made to decipher the scopes and limits of 'the North', the 'Circumpolar North' or the 'Arctic' and up to this point no fully satisfactory definition, at least for this author, has been found.Contrary to what the Arctic as a geographical region entails, despite the ambiguities surrounding the definition ofArctic cultures appear to be more clearly defined legally by law-makers. Conditions are inserted into legal regimes that lay down conditions for what constitutes a 'real' Arctic culture and what does not. Along with these criteria go the conditions for the delimitations of Arctic economies which, as shown by Gl√∏msrod and Aslaksen, are diverse and complex in nature.First and foremost, these legal reflections of Arctic narratives unveil significant shortcomings in knowledge regarding livelihoods and economies of contemporary Arctic societies. At the same time, legal regimes now attempt to include Arctic and other indigenous cultures, their traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and livelihoods as a valuable element in sustainable development and environmental protection.

For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)in its Article 8(j) lays out that the contracting parties are to 'respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity'. While this is held very broadly and is not limited to Arctic indigenous peoples, it becomes more concrete in a Canadian context where, for example, the Oceans Actin Article 42(j) stipulates that traditional ecological knowledge is to be used 'for the purpose of understanding oceans and their living resources and ecosystems'. Procter questions how far this approach towards TEK reflects the interests of the knowledge holders and argues that the discourse surrounding TEK and its embodiment in law ultimately reflect neo-colonial approaches given the inherently exploitative nature with which TEK is utilised.Thus, conceptualising the cultural practices and knowledge systems under the banner 'traditional ecological knowledge', 21 while well-meaning, neglects the cultural diversity of indigenous peoples, simplifies the socio-cultural attachments to the knowledge as well as negating the achievement and generation of this knowledge.

A deeper analysis of 'knowledge' in the Arctic and elsewhere, particularly in environmental governance, furthermore reveals a systemic bias in approach: although the CBD explicitly refers to 'indigenous and local knowledge', by and large the terms 'traditional' and 'local' are equated with indigenous knowledge holders. The same, I argue, is prevalent in the notion of 'tradition' or 'traditionality'. Indeed, Berkes exemplifies this with reference to the West Indies and notes: 'Strictly speaking, the West Indies is one part of the world in which traditional systems do not exist' since 'the indigenous populations  have almost completely disappeared'.This approach, as Berkes himself acknowledges, neglects that vast ranges of long-standing systems that have developed (or are developing) based on which management systems have evolved or are evolving. Inevitably, whether or not those engaged in the development of these systems are considered indigenous or not is epistemically irrelevant.
