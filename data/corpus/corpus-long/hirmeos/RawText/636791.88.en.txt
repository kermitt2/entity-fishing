Even more restrictive assumptions can be made, which specify the kind of entity or entities out of which everything is composed. And at the other end of the spectrum, much looser, less restrictive assumptions could be made which, if true, would still make science possible. Thus science could assume that the universe is such that local observable phenomena occur, most of the time, to a high degree of approximation, in accordance with some yet-to-be-discovered physical theory that is not too seriously disunified.

It is always possible, of course, that the universe only appears to be physically unified (to some extent). Perhaps, as theoretical physics advances, everything will become increasingly complex (as even some physicists believe 18 ). Perhaps a malicious God is in charge, who has been controlling the universe up to now in such a way that it is as if physics prevails everywhere, but who, shortly, will startle us all by causing a series of dramatic, large-scale miracles to occur which violate all known laws. Perhaps as we probe deeper into physical reality we will discover that the universe exemplifies, not physical laws, but something that is closer to a computer program (as some people have suggested). The universe may be comprehensible, but not physically comprehensible. That is, it may be that something exists-God, a society of gods, an overall cosmic purpose, a cosmic "computer" programwhich controls or determines the way events occur, and in terms of which, in principle, everything can be explained and understood: but this something may not be a unified physical entity, a unified pattern of physical law, and thus the universe, though comprehensible, is not physically comprehensible. Finally, the universe may not be comprehensible at all, and yet it might still be possible for us to live, and to acquire some knowledge of our local circumstances.

How do we choose between these endless possibilities? Science must make some kind of choice. It is all-important that science makes the correct choice, or at least a good choice, since this choice will determine what (non-empirical) methods are employed by science to assess theories. If science chooses a cosmological thesis that is radically false, then science will only consider false theories, and will exclude from consideration all theories that might take us towards the truth. Science will come to a dead end. The more restrictive the chosen cosmological assumption is, so the more potentially helpful it will be in selecting theories, but also the more likely the assumption is to be radically false, thus imposing a block on scientific progress. On the other hand, the looser, the more unrestrictive the assumption is, so the more likely it is to be true, but the less helpful it will be in excluding empirically successful "disunified" theories. (Other things being equal, the less one says, the more likely it is that what one says is true. "The universe is not a chicken" is almost certainly true about ultimate reality, just because it says so little, there being an awful lot of ways in which the universe can not be a chicken.)

It is all-important that science makes the right assumption about the ultimate nature of reality; and yet it is just here, concerning the ultimate nature of reality, that we are most ignorant, and are almost bound to get things wrong. How on earth are we to proceed?

The solution to this dilemma-the fundamental epistemological and methodological dilemma of science-is to make, not one cosmological assumption, but a hierarchy of assumptions, the assumptions becoming less and less restrictive, asserting less and less, as one goes up the hierarchy (see

, and associated text spelling out aspects of this hierarchical view.

The figures make things look complicated, but the basic idea is extremely simple. By displaying assumptions and associated methodsaims and methods-in this hierarchical fashion, we create a framework of high-level, relatively unspecific, unproblematic, fixed assumptions and methods within which low-level, much more specific, problematic assumptions and methods may be revised as science proceeds, in the light of the relative empirical success and failure of rival scientific research programmes to which rival assumptions lead. If currently adopted cosmological assumptions, and associated methods, fail to support the growth of empirical knowledge, or fail to do so as apparently successfully as rival assumptions and methods, then assumptions and associated methods are changed, at whatever level appears to be required.Every effort is made, however, to confine such revisions to cosmological theses as low down in the hierarchy of theses as possible. Only persistent, long-term, dramatic failure (at levels 1 and 2) would lead us to revise ideas above level 3, let alone above level 4; only an earthquake in our understanding of the universe would lead us to revise ideas above level 5. In this way we give ourselves the best hope of making progress, of acquiring authentic knowledge, while at the same time minimizing the chances of being taken up the garden path, or being stuck in a cul de sac. The hope is that as we increase our knowledge about the world, we improve the cosmological assumptions implicit in our methods, and thus in turn improve our methods. As a result of improving our knowledge, we improve our knowledge about how to improve knowledge. Science adapts its own nature to what it learns about the nature of the universe, thus increasing its capacity to make progress in knowledge about the world-the methodological key to the astonishing, accelerating, explosive growth of scientific knowledge.
