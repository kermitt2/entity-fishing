The distribution of verbs over these classes is independent of verb semantics. Within the obligatorily prefixed intransitive verbs-waawang 'remember',-mitan 'understand' and-pan 'forget' have similar semantics, yet they belong to the inflection classes pat, gen, and ast, respectively. Similarly,-iwei 'vomit',-tasusin 'be sweaty' and-wilii 'defecate' belong to the classes pat, loc, and gen. Within the obligatorily prefixed transitive verbs-set 'shake up and down' belongs to pat, while-gaook 'shake back and forth' belongs to loc. Similarly,-kut 'stab s.o./sth. ' belongs to pat and-fanee 'strike, shoot s.o./sth. ' to gen. The inflection classes dat and dir contain one verb each and are therefore too small for any common semantics to be discernible.

In the following examples we illustrate the inflection classes in Kamang. For each class we give an intransitive and a transitive example and provide a list of verbs so the reader can further appreciate that classing is independent of verb semantics.show an intransitive verb encoding S with a pat prefix and a transitive verb encoding P with a pat prefix, respectively.

10 Participant marking: Corpus study and video elicitationbelow show an intransitive verb encoding S with a loc prefix and a transitive verb encoding P with a loc prefix, respectively.below show an intransitive verb encoding S with a gen prefix and a transitive verb encoding P with a gen prefix, respectively.

Examples of intransitive verbs in the gen inflection class are:-foi 'dream',-iyaa 'go home',-laita 'shy',-taiyai 'cooperate, work together', and-wilii 'defecate'.

There are only two transitive verbs in the gen inflection class, namely-fanee 'strike, shoot s.o./sth. ' and-towan 'carry sth. on a pole between two people'.below show an intransitive verb encoding S with an ast prefix and a transitive verb encoding P with an ast prefix, respectively.
