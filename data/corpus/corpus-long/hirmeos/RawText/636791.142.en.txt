Introduction

1. Aim-oriented empiricism was first put forward in The Rationality of Scientific DiscoveryAnyone interested in the way the view has evolved over the years should have a look at this two-part paper. 2. In my In Praise of Natural Philosophy (2017b, ch. 7), I make the point that, once it is apparent that the intellectual aims of science are problematic, and hence need to be improved as science proceeds, it becomes obvious that the philosophy of science-the study of what the aims and methods of science ought to be-needs to be an integral, influential part of science itself, if science is to be rigorous. I there go on to generalize this to all worthwhile human endeavours with problematic aims: rationality requires that the philosophy of a life endeavour with a problematic aim must be an influential part of the life endeavour itself (politics, law, international relations, finance, education). 3. For a discussion of these contradictory impulses to be found in Popper's work, together with relevant references to Popper's writings, see Maxwell (2016a). 4. This may be no more than truth at the empirical level, at the level of empirical predictions.

6. I exempt my own work from consideration-work that so far has been almost entirely ignored by mainstream philosophy of science. 7. I have in mind such publications as, Van Fraassen (1980),, Cartwright (1999),and, more recently, Achinstein (2010),, Sober (2015),8. At the time of, the metaphysics of science seems to have become a topic of growing interest: see RescherNone of these works defends, or even expounds, a role for metaphysics in science of the kind required by aim-oriented empiricism. The closest I have come to discovering an exception to this is a book by Craig Dilworth (2007) entitled The Metaphysics of Science. Dilworth expounds only a very inadequate version of the view, and fails to provide the key argument for the view, as I have shown elsewhere (seeDilworth seems to have derived the idea from my work: several times in his book he refers to, where aim-oriented empiricism is expounded and argued for. 9. For Popper's replies to such criticisms, seeintroduction and ch. 1. 10. I stress this point because the one Popperian who has taken note of my criticisms of Popper, David Miller, has accused me, incorrectly, of defending "fallibilist justificationism" (see

He argues that they deserve to be rejected on the grounds that they create more problems than they solve, in particular problems of explanation. This is a relevant consideration granted dressed falsificationism, but not granted bare falsificationism. He also argues that it does not matter if such "silly" theories become potential rivals, since it can be left to scientists themselves to criticize them. But this ignores the fact that it is precisely Popper's methodology which should be providing guidelines for such criticism. Far from condemning such a "silly" theory as worthy of rejection, bare falsificationism holds such a theory to be better than the accepted theory (if it has greater empirical content, is not falsified where the accepted theory appears to be, and some of the excess content of the "silly" theory is corroborated). Popper fails to appreciate that it is his methodology, not he himself, which needs to declare that silly theories are indeed "silly". The fact that his methodology declares these silly theories to be highly acceptable is a devastating indictment of his methodology. To argue that these silly theories, refuting instances of his methodology, do not matter and can be discounted, is all too close to a scientist arguing that evidence, that refutes his theory, should be discounted, something which Popper resoundingly condemns. The falsificationist stricture that scientists should not discount falsifying instances, ought to apply to methodologists as well! 12. In fact even the methodological rules of bare falsificationism are such that persistent application of these rules commits one to making implicit metaphysical assumptions (which may be false). Bare falsificationism, as formulated by Popper, requires of an acceptable theory that it is strictly universal in that it makes no reference to any specific time, place or object. This makes it impossible for science to discover that the laws of nature just are different within specific space-time regions, or that there is a specific object with unique dynamical properties. There is no scope, within bare falsificationism, for the rejection of these metaphysical theses, even though circumstances could conceivably arise such that progress in knowledge would require this. (AOE, by contrast, allows for this remote possibility: that which is dogmatically upheld by bare falsificationism becomes criticizable granted AOE.) Popper recognizes that the methodological rule requiring any theory to be strictly universal does have a metaphysical counterpart (1959, sections 11 and 79), but fails to appreciate how damaging this is for falsificationism. 13. It may be objected that persistent acceptance of unified theories in physics when endlessly many empirically more successful disunified rivals are available does not mean that physics makes a metaphysical assumption about the underlying unity of the universe. Unified theories are accepted over disunified rivals because they are better verified-or better corroborated, as Popper would say. But whether unified theories are more likely to be true-other things being (more or less) equal-depends on what kind of universe we are in. In a unified universe, unified theories will, no doubt, be more likely to be true, but in a disunified universe, the opposite holds-and we have no valid reasons to hold that the former is more likely to be true than the latter. For a decisive refutation of this and other objections to AOE, and to the key argument for AOE, see Maxwell (2015a). 14. To say that M 1 "supports" an empirically successful research programme is to say that the programme develops a succession of theories, each empirically more successful than its predecessors, in a Popperian sense, and each being closer to exemplifying, to being a precise, testable instantiation of, M 1 than its predecessors. 15.
