(4) T postulates physical entities interacting by means of N distinct forces, different forces affecting different entities, and being specified by different force laws. (In this case one would require one force to be universal so that the universe does not fall into distinct parts that do not interact with one another.)

Example: T postulates particles that interact by means of Newtonian gravitation; some of these also interact by means of an electrostatic force F = Kq 1 q 2 / d 2 , this force being attractive if q 1 and q 2 are oppositely charged, otherwise being repulsive, the force being much stronger than gravitation. Here, N = 2 in a type (4) way.

(5) T postulates N different kinds of physical entity, 5 differing with respect to some dynamic property, such as value of mass or charge, but otherwise interacting by means of the same force.

Example: T postulates particles that interact by means of Newtonian gravitation, there being three kinds of particles, of mass m, 2m and 3m. Here, N = 3 in a type (5) way.

(6) Consider a theory, T, that postulates N distinct kinds of entity (e.g. particles or fields), but these N entities can be regarded as arising because T exhibits some symmetry (in the way that the electric and magnetic fields of classical electromagnetism can be regarded as arising because of the symmetry of Lorentz invariance, or the eight gluons of chromodynamics can be regarded as arising as a result of the local gauge symmetry of SU). If the symmetry group, G, is not a direct product of subgroups, we can declare that T is fully unified; if G is a direct product of subgroups, T lacks full unity; and if the N entities are such that they cannot be regarded as arising as a result of some symmetry of T, with some group structure G, then T is disunified. 6 Example: Classical electrodynamics postulates two fields: the electric and the magnetic fields. However, the relative strengths of these fields differ when measured in different inertial reference frames travelling with uniform velocity with respect to each other, although the strength of the combined electromagnetic field does not. But, according to special relativity, laws have the same form with respect to all inertial reference frames. We may hold that the electric and magnetic fields are not two distinct entities. They are, rather, two aspects of one unified entity, the electromagnetic field. To this extent, N = 1 as far as classical electrodynamics is concerned.

(7) If (apparent) disunity of there being N distinct kinds of particle or distinct fields has emerged as a result of cosmic spontaneous symmetry-breaking events, there being manifest unity before these occurred, then the relevant theory, T, is unified. If current (apparent) disunity has not emerged from unity in this way, as a result of spontaneous symmetry-breaking, then the relevant theory, T, is disunified.

Example: Weinberg's and Salam's electroweak theory, according to which at very high energies, such as those that existed soon after the big bang, the electroweak force has the form of two forces, one with three associated massless particles, two charged, W-and W + , and one neutral, W o , and the other with one neutral massless particle, V o. According to the theory, the two neutral particles, W o and V o , are intermingled in two different ways, to form two new neutral particles, the photon, , and another neutral massless particle, Z o. As energy decreases, the W + , W-and Z o particles acquire mass, due to the mechanism known as spontaneous symmetry-breaking (involving the Higgs particle), while the photon, , retains its zero mass. This theory unifies the weak and electro magnetic forces as a result of exhibiting the symmetry of local gauge invariance; this unification is only partial, however, because the symmetry group is a direct product of two groups, U(1) associated with V o , and SU(2) associated with W-, W + and W o .(8) According to GR, Newton's force of gravitation is merely an aspect of the curvature of space-time. As a result of a change in our ideas about the nature of space-time, so that its geometric properties become dynamic, a physical force disappears, or becomes unified with space-time. This suggests the following requirement for unity: space-time on the one hand, and physical "particles-and-forces" on the other, must be unified into a single self-interacting entity, U. If T postulates space-time and physical particles-and-forces as two fundamentally distinct kinds of entity, then T is not unified in this respect.

Example: one might imagine that the quantization of spacetime leads to the appearance of particles and forces as only apparently distinct from empty space-time. Here, N = 1 in a type (8) way: there is just the one self-interacting entity, empty space-time.
