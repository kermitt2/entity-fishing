2.4 Refutation of dressed falsificationism

Having argued thatbare falsificationism is untenable, I turn my attention now to) doctrine of dressed falsificationism. As I have mentioned, this adds on to the (1959) doctrine Popper's new "requirement of simplicity"(see section 2.2 above).

As long as there is no serious ambiguity as to what proceeding "from some simple, new, and powerful, unifying idea" means, it is at once clear that the new doctrine is able to exclude from science all the empirically successful but ad hoc, aberrant, crackpot, silly theories, of the kind discussed above. They do not proceed "from some simple  unifying idea", and are to be rejected on that account, whatever their empirical success may be, even if this empirical success is greater than accepted scientific theories.

However, adopting Popper's new "principle of simplicity" as a basic methodological principle of science has the effect of permanently excluding from science all ad hoc theories that fail to satisfy the principle, however empirically successful such theories might be if considered. This amounts to assuming permanently that the universe is such that all ad hoc theories that fail to satisfy Popper's principle of simplicity are false-granted that a basic aim of science is truth. It amounts to accepting, as a permanent item of scientific knowledge, the substantial metaphysical thesis that the universe is non-ad hoc, in the sense that all theories that fail to satisfy Popper's principle of simplicity are false, however empirically successful they might turn out to be if considered. But this, of course, clashes with Popper's criterion of demarcation: that no unfalsifiable, metaphysical thesis is to be accepted as a part of scientific knowledge.

If the demarcation principle is upheld, then the metaphysical thesis just indicated, asserting that the universe is non-ad hoc, remains implicit in the permanent adoption of Popper's principle of simplicity as a basic methodological principle of science. (And this is the way Popper himself seems to have conceived the matter: he says of metaphysical research programmes that they are "often held unconsciously", and "are implicit in the theories and in the attitudes and judgements of the scientists") But in leaving the metaphysical thesis of non-ad hocness implicit in the methodological principle of simplicity, science violates an elementary requirement for rationality, already mentioned, according to which "assumptions that are substantial, influential, problematic and implicit need to be made explicit, so that they can be critically assessed and so that alternatives may be put forward and considered, in the hope that such assumptions can be improved"The non-ad hoc metaphysical assumption may, after all, be false. We may need to adopt a modified version of the assumption. It may be essential for the progress of science that this assumption is modified. Just this turns out to be the case, given certain formulations of the assumption, as we shall see below. In leaving the non-ad hoc metaphysical assumption implicit in the adoption of the methodological principle of simplicity, dressed falsificationism protects this substantial, influential and highly problematic assumption from criticism, from the active consideration of alternatives.Dressed falsificationism fails, in other words, for good Popperian reasons: it is inconsistent, in that the untestable, metaphysical thesis that the universe is non-ad hoc is accepted implicitly as a part of conjectural scientific knowledge, in conflict with the principle of demarcation; and it lacks rigour, in that it protects this implicit, metaphysical assumption from explicit criticism within the intellectual domain of science.

Here again, it should be noted, there is nothing justificationist about this criticism of Popper's dressed falsificationism. On the contrary, what the argument shows is that dressed falsificationism protects a substantial, influential, problematic but implicit assumption from criticism within science: Popper's doctrine fails for the good Popperian reason of restricting criticism.

It may be objected that adopting Popper's methodological principle of simplicity does not commit science to making a substantial metaphysical assumption about the universe-namely that it is such that no falsifiable theory, however empirically successful, which fails to satisfy the principle, is true. But I do not see how such an objection can be valid. Suppose, instead of adopting Popper's principle, science adopted the principle that in order to be acceptable, a new physical theory must postulate that the universe is made up of atoms. This methodological principle is upheld in such a way that even though theories are available which postulate fields rather than atoms, and which are much more empirically successful than any atomic theory, nevertheless these rival field theories are all excluded from science. Would it not be clear that science, in adopting and implementing the methodological principle of atomicity in this way, is making the assumption that the universe is made up of atoms, whether this is acknowledged or not? How can this be denied? Just the same holds if science adopts and implements Popper's methodological principle of simplicity.
