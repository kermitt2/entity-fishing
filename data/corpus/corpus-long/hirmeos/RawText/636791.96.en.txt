By the SE prescription I mean this: in order to develop science in a properly scientific, rigorous way, so that it is capable of delivering authentic, reliable knowledge, science must eschew all metaphysical presuppositions in the context of justification and base acceptance of scientific theories as far as possible solely on empirical considerations without reference to conjectural metaphysics. If this is correct, then it makes perfect sense to demand of any attempt to solve the practical problem of induction that it satisfies the SE requirement. But the SE prescription-eschewing metaphysical presuppositions in order to render science scientific and rigorous-is, we have seen, an intellectual disaster. It has entirely the opposite effect of the one intended. If taken seriously, instead of enhancing the rigour of science, it would destroy science and, indeed, all knowledge. The arguments of this and previous chapters demonstrate that science devoid of metaphysics is not possible. Selecting theories on the basis of empirical success and failure, no kind of assumption being made about what kind of world this is, cannot succeed if rigorously pursued, because science would be overwhelmed by endlessly many empirically successful aberrant theories which would stultify science and render technological application impossible. (Or, if requirements of simplicity and unity are invoked, in addition to empirical requirements, then metaphysical assumptions of unity are being presupposed, but in a surreptitious fashion.) Science has survived and progressed despite, and not because of, acceptance of SE by the scientific community. Science has managed to do this by implementing SE in only a highly unrigorous and hypocritical fashion (implicit metaphysical presuppositions exercising a highly influential role over choice of theory).

The SE prescription is, then, an intellectual disaster. Unfounded metaphysical or cosmological conjectures about the comprehensibility and knowability of the universe are essential for science, and cannot be eliminated without disaster. What needs to be implemented, instead, is the "AOE prescription": roughly, endeavour to improve metaphysical assumptions explicit or implicit in current science and knowledge; do this by modifying existing assumptions in that direction which seems to be the most fruitful from the standpoint of acquiring empirical knowledge within a fixed framework of assumptions and methods which are such that these are required for the acquisition of knowledge to be possible at all. In other words, put generalized AOE into practice.

Before the advent of SE, the pursuit of science, or of knowledge more generally, invariably went on within a framework of religious and metaphysical assumptions. Christianity, the corpuscular hypothesis, and Galileo's thesis that the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics, played especially important roles in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as far as the birth and development of modern science was concerned. The orthodox SE prescription insists that science must be dissociated from such dubious, unfounded religious and metaphysical doctrines. But this cannot be done; at best, unrigorous and hypocritical science results. The impression that it has been done creates the insoluble problem of induction (as traditionally construed, from the SE perspective).

Instead, we need to see AOE science as explicitly improving on antecedently upheld religious and metaphysical theses. There is, in science, a substantial component of faith-but, ideally, it is rational faith, openly acknowledged as conjectural in character, subjected to sustained criticism, and undergoing persistent modification in the direction of that which seems to lead to the most empirically progressive research, at levels 1 and 2. Science does not eliminate metaphysics; it implements a method which makes it possible for us to develop and choose those metaphysical ideas most fruitful for progress in empirical knowledge.

But once the SE prescription has been rejected as intellectually disastrous, and the AOE prescription accepted instead, it is clear that the SE requirement for solving the practical problem of induction must itself be rejected as intellectually unreasonable and unacceptable. The only rationale for adopting it arises from the idea that it is entirely proper to put the SE prescription into practice. But putting this into practice makes science impossible (for reasons wholly in addition to the resulting insolubility of the practical problem of induction). The SE requirement presumes a state of knowledge that has resulted from implementing the intellectually destructive SE prescription: this state of knowledge is an intellectual disaster, and must be rejected, and along with it the SE requirement.

Taking the SE requirement seriously is rather like an athlete having both legs amputated and then expecting to win the 100 metres at the Olympics. Render science, and indeed all knowledge, impossible (by throwing away vital metaphysics) and it should occasion no surprise that a situation is created in which the practical problem of induction becomes impossible to solve as well.

For the last four centuries ever since Galileo, or perhaps for the last two and a half thousand years ever since the Presocratics, physicalism has been by far the most fruitful metaphysical thesis available from the standpoint of promoting progress in science, or in knowledge more generally. No rival metaphysical thesis has been remotely as fruitful. AOE correctly depicts our current scientific knowledge. Physicalism, in short, is justifiably a basic tenet of current (conjectural) scientific knowledge, our best attempt, at that vital level, of acquiring knowledge of truth, more secure, indeed, than any fundamental physical theory, such as quantum theory or general relativity. It makes very good sense not to jump off the Eiffel Tower if you want to stay alive, for the reasons given above.
