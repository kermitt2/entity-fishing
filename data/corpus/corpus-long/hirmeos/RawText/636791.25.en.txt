It may be objected that AOE suffers from vicious circularity, in that acceptance of physical theories is justified by (in part) an appeal to physicalism, the acceptance of which is justified, in turn, by the empirical success of physical theory. My reply to this objection is that the level 6 thesis of meta-knowability asserts that the universe is such that this kind of circular methodology, there being positive feedback between metaphysics, methods and empirically successful theories, is just what we need to employ in order to improve our knowledge. The thesis of meta-knowability, if true, justifies implementation of AOE. This response is only valid, of course, if reasons for accepting the level 6 thesis of metaknowability do not themselves appeal to the success of science (which would just reintroduce vicious circularity at a higher level). As I made clear above, the two arguments given for accepting meta-knowability make no appeal to the success of science whatsoever.A basic idea of AOE is to channel or direct criticism so that it is as fruitful as possible, from the standpoint of aiding progress in knowledge. The function of criticism within science is to promote scientific progress. When criticism demonstrably cannot help promote scientific progress, it becomes irrational (the idea behind (2) above). In an attempt to make criticism as fruitful as possible, we need to try to direct it at targets which are the most fruitful, the most productive, to criticize (from the standpoint of the growth of knowledge). This is the basic idea behind the hierarchy of AOE. Conjectures at all levels remain open to criticism. But, as we ascend the hierarchy, conjectures are less and less likely to be false; it is less and less likely that criticism, here, will help promote scientific knowledge. The best currently available level 3 conjecture is almost bound to be false: at this level, the history of physics reveals, as I have indicated above, that a number of different conjectures have been adopted and rejected in turn. Here, criticism, the activity of developing alternatives (compatible with physicalism), is likely to be immensely fruitful for progress in theoretical physics. Indeed, elsewhere I have argued that this provides physics with a rational, though fallible and nonmechanical method for the discovery of new fundamental physical theories,a method invented and exploited by Einstein in discovering special and general relativity (see the next chapter) something which Popper has argued is not possible (seeCriticizing physicalism, at level 4, may also be fruitful for physics, 21 but (the conjecture of AOE is that) this is not as likely to be as fruitful as criticism at level 3. And, as we ascend the hierarchy (so AOE conjectures), criticism becomes progressively less and less likely to be fruitful. Against that, it must be admitted that the higher in the hierarchy we need to modify our ideas, so the more dramatic would be the intellectual revolution that this would bring about. If physicalism is rejected altogether, and some quite different version of the level 5 conjecture of comprehensibility is adopted instead, the whole character of natural science would change dramatically; physics, as we know it, might even cease to exist.

The biggest change, in moving from falsificationism to AOE, has to do with the role of metaphysics in science, and the scope of scientific knowledge. According to falsificationism, untestable metaphysical theses may influence scientific research in the context of discovery, and may even lead to metaphysical research programmes; they cannot, however, be a part of scientific knowledge itself. But according to AOE, the metaphysical theses at levels 3 to 7 are all part of current (conjectural) scientific knowledge. This is the case, in particular, as far as physicalism is concerned. According to AOE, it is a part of current scientific knowledge that the universe is physically comprehensible-certainly not the case granted falsificationism.

Another important change has to do with the relationship between science and the philosophy of science. Falsificationism places the study of scientific method, the philosophy of science, outside science itself, in accordance with Popper's demarcation principle. AOE, by contrast, makes scientific method and the philosophy of science an integral part of science itself. The activity of tackling problems inherent in the aims of science, at a variety of levels, and of developing new possible aims and methods, new possible more specific or less specific philosophies of science (views about what the aims and methods of science ought to be) is, according to AOE, a vital research activity of science itself. But this is also philosophy of science, being carried on within the framework of AOE.AOE differs in many other important ways from Popper's falsificationism, whether bare or dressed (seeNevertheless the impulse, the intellectual aspirations and values, behind the hierarchical view of AOE are, as I have tried to indicate, thoroughly Popperian in character and spirit. The whole idea is to turn implicit assumptions into explicit conjectures in such a way that criticism may be directed at what most needs to be criticized from the standpoint of aiding progress in knowledge, so that conjectures may be developed and adopted that are the most fruitful in promoting scientific progress, at the same time no substantial conjecture, implicit or explicit, being held immune from critical scrutiny.
