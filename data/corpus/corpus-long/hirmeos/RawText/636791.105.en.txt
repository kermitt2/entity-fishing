Popper's failure to recognize the vital need to create or develop a version of tribal unity within the diversity, complexity and sheer immensity of the modern world, in order to preserve and develop reason, mutual cooperation, humanity and civilization, is intimately connected with his analogous failure to recognize the vital role that fundamental unifying assumptions play in science, and in academic inquiry in general. Scientific, academic inquiry has basic presuppositions about what sort of world this is, and what is important or of value in social life, built into its whole intellectual-institutional structure, built into the priorities for research, built into its implicit methodology. According to universalism, these basic presuppositions need to be explicitly articulated and scrutinized-thus creating a tradition of discussion of presupposed solutions to fundamental problems-if scientific, academic inquiry is to be genuinely rational and rigorous, of maximum human value and use. Only by putting universalism into scientific, academic practice can we do justice to-and develop-the inherent rationality, the intellectually progressive character and the human value of the best of scientific, academic work and thought. As we shall see below, Popper fails to characterize adequately the rationality and progressive character of science-in that, for example, he fails to solve the problem of inductionjust because he fails to do justice to the need for fundamental metaphysical and evaluative assumptions persisting through scientific revolutions, scientific diversity.

The Open Society and Its Enemies fails to characterize a genuinely rational society; The Logic of Scientific Discovery) fails to characterize a genuinely rational science: both failures are by-products of Popper's basic failure to articulate and advocate the hierarchical structure of universalism, so essential for genuinely rational, cooperative problem solving and inquiry in life as well as thought.

Having argued that we need to recognize, quite generally, that our thinking goes on in the world, presupposing a view of the world and a view of what is of value in life, I am of course eager to acknowledge that my advocacy of universalism in this chapter is intimately bound up with a view of what sort of world this is and what is of value in life-a broad, general, fundamental answer to the fundamental questions (1) and (3) above. As to the material universe, I hold a view not too dissimilar from the overall conception of the world implicit in much of modern science-a view of the world which does justice to the probable truth of Einstein's remark that "all our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike-and yet it is [one of] the most precious thingI recognize, of course, the intellectual legitimacy of conceptions of the world-such as animistic and religious views-very different from that of modern science. Critical fundamentalist inquiry acknowledges such rivals, and retreats to a more modest "common sense" view of the world, designed to be indifferent between these rival, explanatorily fundamental views, so that there may be a common, agreed base, in terms of which the merits of the rival explanatorily fundamental views may be discussed. (Universalism recognizes, in other words, that, in certain contexts, and for certain purposes, the epistemologically fundamental may differ from what is presumed to be ontologically and explanatorily fundamental.)

As to that which is of value, I hold that all that is of value in existence has to do with life, and especially, for us, with human life. Enjoyment in living; curiosity and wonder; perceptive awareness, understanding and appreciation of significant and beautiful aspects of the world; kindness, laughter, honesty, friendship, love, intimacy, cooperative creative work, personal responsibility, happiness, fulfilment: these are the kind of things that are of value. For each one of us, this short life is our only opportunity to discover, experience and take part in life of value; all too many people in the modern world-especially the developing worldlack this opportunity. We need to do all we can to change things so that all people everywhere have the opportunity to realize what is of most value in life. Value in the world has much to do with the diversity of life, the unique particularity of each individual life. A uniform world would be a world denuded of value. It is of the essence of value-it is essentially desirable and of value-that there be multiplicity and variety, amongst people, amongst ways of life, amongst societies and cultures. However, if this desirable variety is to flourish in this one crowded world, it is essential that we discover how to cooperate, to learn from and understand each other, in the midst of this variety. And there is a further point. As I have remarked above, much of what is of value in life comes directly from good things that go on between people-mutual understanding and appreciation, sharing, intimacy, cooperative creative work. Such interpersonal or social things, of value in themselves, only become possible in a world full of variety if there is cooperation, communication, learning and understanding amidst variety. Variety is only enriching in so far as there is understanding and learning between people amidst variety. It is to help facilitate all this that I advocate universalism (or critical fundamentalism). Universalism is put forward as a conception of learning and problem solving designed, above all, to help us resolve more adequately the third and fourth of the above fundamental problems.
