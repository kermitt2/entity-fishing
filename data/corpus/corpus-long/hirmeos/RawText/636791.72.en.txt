Meta-knowability asserts, in short, that the universe is such that AOE can meet with success and will not lead us astray in a way in which we cannot hope to discover by normal methods of scientific inquiry (as would be the case in a type (iii) universe). If we have good grounds for accepting meta-knowability as a part of scientific knowledge-grounds which do not appeal to the success of science-then we have good grounds for adopting and implementing AOE (from levels 8 to 3).

But what grounds are there for accepting the thesis of metaknowability at level (6)? There are two:(a) Granted that there is some kind of general feature of the universe which makes it possible to acquire knowledge of our local environment (as guaranteed by the thesis at level 8), it is reasonable to suppose that we do not know all that there is to be known about what the nature of this general feature is. It is reasonable to suppose, in other words, that we can improve our knowledge about the nature of this general feature, thus improving methods for the improvement of knowledge. Not to suppose this is to assume, arrogantly, that we already know all that there is to be known about how to acquire new knowledge. Granted that learning is possible (as guaranteed by the level 8 thesis), it is reasonable to suppose that, as we learn more about the world, we will learn more about how to learn. Granted the level 8 thesis, in other words, metaknowability is a reasonable conjecture. (b) Meta-knowability is too good a possibility, from the standpoint of the growth of knowledge, not to be accepted initially, the idea only being reluctantly abandoned if all attempts at improving methods for the improvement of knowledge fail.

(a) and (b) are not, perhaps, very strong grounds for accepting metaknowability; both are open to criticism. But the crucial point, for the present argument, is that these grounds for accepting meta-knowability, (a) and (b), are independent of the success of science. This suffices to avoid circularity. If AOE lacks meta-knowability, its circular procedure, interpreted as one designed to procure justified knowledge, becomes dramatically invalid, as the following consideration reveals. Corresponding to the succession of accepted fundamental physical theories developed from Newton down to today, there is a succession of aberrant rivals which postulate that gravitation becomes a repulsive force from the beginning of 2050, let us say.Corresponding to these aberrant theories there is a hierarchy of aberrant versions of physicalism, all of which assert that there is an abrupt change in the laws of nature at 2050. The aberrant theories, just as empirically successful as the theories we accept, render the aberrant versions of physicalism just as scientifically fruitful as non-aberrant versions of physicalism are rendered by the non-aberrant theories we actually accept. If we take it as given that we accept non-aberrant theories, the question of what reasons there are for rejecting empirically successful aberrant theories and associated aberrant versions of physicalism does not arise. But the moment we seek to justify acceptance of non-aberrant theories and rejection of aberrant theories, within the framework of AOE, the question of what reasons there are for rejecting aberrant theories and associated aberrant versions of physicalism arises. If AOE is bereft of meta-knowability, it is not easy to see what these reasons can be. But AOE with meta-knowability included does provide a reason: the aberrant versions of physicalism assert that this is a type (iii) universe, which violates meta-knowability.

Versions of physicalism(n) for which n = 1 or 3, and N > 1 would seem to violate meta-knowability. But other versions of physicalism with N > 1 need not clash with meta-knowability.5.10 Conclusions

I have argued that if science is to be rigorous it needs to accept explicitly, as a core component of theoretical scientific knowledge, a hierarchy of metaphysical theses (and associated methods) concerning the dynamic unity, the physical comprehensibility, of the universe. I have shown that the notorious problem concerning the unity, the explanatory character, of physical theory can be solved within this hierarchical view of science. This solution, in turn, provides a precise way of assessing the scientific fruitfulness of rival metaphysical theses, from the standpoint of the empirical progressiveness of the research programmes to which they give rise.

These results have dramatic implications for science, for our understanding of science, and for the relationship between science and philosophy. There is a major increase in the (acknowledged) scope of scientific knowledge. Whereas standard empiricism implies that science at present provides us with no knowledge about the ultimate nature of the universe (all current fundamental physical theories being false), the hierarchical view holds the opposite. Current science does include knowledge about the ultimate nature of the universeknowledge which, though theoretical and conjectural, is nevertheless more secure than any accepted theory such as quantum theory or general relativity: physicalism(5-7) is true, even perhaps physicalism(8). Science becomes much more like natural philosophy, in that it incorporates sustained exploration and assessment of metaphysical theses, and associated metholodogical rules, as an integral, vital part of scientific research. Instead of metaphysics and philosophy being banished from science, they become a vital part of science.
