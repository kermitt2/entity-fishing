Nevertheless, the central tenet of Popper's thought in effect lends strength to a mainstay of specialism, namely traditional empiricism. Much of Popper's later writings elaborate and apply the main thesis of his first book The Logic of ScientificThere Popper seeks to solve a problem central to traditional empiricism, namely how to demarcate science from metaphysics. Popper's solution, of course, is that a theory, in order to be scientific, must be experimentally falsifiable. A discipline, in order to be scientific, must assess theories solely with respect to empirical considerations, priority being given to those theories which have best survived severe testing and are most amenable to being severely tested. In other words, Popper, along with Bacon, Mill, Duhem, Hempel and others, is centrally concerned to drive a sharp and decisive wedge between the assessment of specialized, partial solutions to scientific problems (laws and theories) and the assessment of solutions to the fundamental problem of science, namely metaphysical answers to the question: What kind of world is this? In Conjectures and Refutations Popper makes the matter altogether explicit when he defends "the principle of empiricism which asserts that in science, only observation and experiment may decide upon the acceptance or rejection of scientific statements, including laws and theories"Dramatically and decisively, Popper rejects the basic tenet of the critical fundamentalist conception of science, as outlined above.

However, as we have seen, and as I have argued at greater length elsewhere, 31 this "standard empiricist" viewpoint is unacceptable. The insolubility of the problem of induction as formulated, for example, by Popper, shows clearly that scientific laws and theories-solutions to specialized scientific problems-cannot be assessed solely with respect to empirical success, in an entirely impartial fashion. If we honestly attempted to select theories in this way, we would always be overwhelmed by a vast number of complex, empirically successful theories, and we would fail to select the theories we do actually select in science. In practice, in science selection of theories is permanently biased in the direction of simplicity and unity, even to the extent of overruling mere empirical success. This means that in scientific practice, whether we recognize it or not, we presuppose that the universe has some kind of underlying unified structure (or at least that it behaves as if it had such an underlying structure, to a high degree of approximation). In other words, science is only possible in so far as a more or less specific, tentative answer is given to the question "What kind of world is this?" Much of the success of modern science depends upon the aptness of this answer-so we may well judge. The answer is built into the whole methodology of science. In order to pursue science in a genuinely rational fashion, in a fashion which gives us the best hope of making real progress in improving our knowledge and understanding, we need to propose and criticize modified versions of our answer to the question "What kind of world is this?" as an integral part of science. We need to do this in an attempt to improve further the methods, and the success, of science. We need in short to put universalism into practice. Any attempt, like Popper's, to characterize science in terms of fixed methods which select theories solely with respect to empirical success (and the lack of it) must fail to solve the problem of induction-simply because science, so characterized, violates the two most basic rules of rational problem solving. 32 In addition, the vital capacity of science to develop improved methods with improving knowledge, such an essential feature of scientific progress, must inevitably be missed out.Instead of holding speculation about the ultimate nature of the universe to be metaphysical, philosophical, and thus of questionable scientific status, if not downright unscientific or even meaningless, we need, rather, actively to pursue such speculation, imaginatively and critically, as an integral part of science itself. We need to put into practice the kind of critical fundamentalist way of doing science so brilliantly initiated and exploited by Einstein, in developing the special and general theories of relativity.That specialized scientific problem solving requires some kind of answer to be given to the question "What kind of world is this?" has been vividly and dramatically demonstrated by Kuhn in his book The Structure of ScientificKuhn establishes convincingly that the "puzzle solving" of normal science depends upon the acceptance of a paradigm-in effect a Weltanschauung, a view of the world, for a given scientific discipline. One might well suppose that Kuhn, having realized this crucial point, this decisive objection to specialism, would go on to defend universalism, and the need for sustained development and criticism of "paradigms" as an integral part of science. Kuhn, of course, does exactly the opposite. Discussion of fundamental issues has, for Kuhn, no place within a "mature" science.Furthermore, for Kuhn, changes of paradigm-scientific revolutions-inevitably involve a breakdown of rationality. Instead of emphasizing that rational assessment of paradigms is essential for the rationality of the whole of science-as universalism does-Kuhn, on the contrary, declares that choice of paradigm in general lies beyond the scope of reason (see
