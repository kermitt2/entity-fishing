Interestingly enough, Lakatos himself was aware of this deficiency in his "plea to Popper for a whiff of

Discussing his proposal that one should appeal to a metaphysical inductive principle as a conjecture as a part of the solution to the problem of induction, Lakatos says:

Alas, a solution is interesting only if it is embedded in, or leads to, a major research programme; if it creates new problems-and solutions-in turn. But this would be the case only if such an inductive principle could be sufficiently richly formulated so that one may, say criticize our scientific game from its point of view. My inductive principle tries to explain why we "play" the game of science. But it does so in an ad hoc, not in a "fact-correcting" (or, if you wish, "basic value judgment correcting") way.Lakatos highlights, here, the difference between his own position and that of AOE. The (revisable) AOE thesis of physicalism is indeed "sufficiently richly formulated so that one may  criticize our scientific game from its point of view". AOE not only offers a new research programme for the philosophy of science, it modifies the research programme of science, one modification being that the philosophy of science becomes an integral part of science itself. The passage above makes me wonder whether Lakatos might not have gone on to develop or endorse AOE if he had lived.

Einstein, aim-oriented empiricism, and the discovery of special and general relativity *

3.1 Einstein's new method of discovery

According to Popper, Einstein is a falsificationist. Thus Popper declares: "Einstein consciously seeks error elimination. He tries to kill his theories: he is consciously critical of his theories"And elsewhere Popper declares: "what I have done is mainly to make explicit certain points which are implicit in the work of Einstein"Paul Feyerabend, on the other hand, holds Einstein to be a methodological "opportunist or cynic" or, in other words, a methodological anarchist; see also p. 18 and pp. 56-7 and note). For Arthur Fine, Einstein adopts a view close to the natural ontological attitude (NOA). Fine writes: "In its antimetaphysical aspect, NOA is at one with Einstein's motivational realism"As far as I know, van Fraassen has not yet claimed that Einstein is a constructive empiricist but, amazingly, the claim has been made on his behalf by Fine, who writes:

Indeed it would not be too far off if we summarized Einstein's views this way: "Science aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and acceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically adequate" [a straight quote from Van Fraassen's The Scientific Image (1980)]  My argument, then, is that if we understand Einstein in the way that he asks us to, his own realist-sounding language maps out a position closer to constructive empiricism than to either "metaphysical realism" or "scientific realism".

The temptation to see one's own view in Einstein's thought is, it seems, all but irresistible. I too, it seems, am unable to resist this temptation. For it is my claim that aim-oriented empiricism-the view which, I argued in the last chapter, emerges as a sort of synthesis of the views of Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos but which, at the same time, greatly improves on all these views-is close to Einstein's mature view of science.

I must confess that I did not arrive at aim-oriented empiricism as a result of reading Einstein. I developed the view during the course of criticizing Popper, and as the key to the solution to the problem of induction.At first I was convinced that the orthodox view of science, which I propose to call standard empiricism, had such a dogmatic stranglehold on science that it would be quite impossible for any scientist to uphold aim-oriented empiricism. It did not occur to me that Einstein might be an exception.

By standard empiricism I mean the view that in science theories are accepted and rejected solely on the basis of empirical success and failure. If science gives preference to theories that are simple, unified or explanatory, this must not be done in such a way that the universe itself is permanently assumed to be simple, unified or comprehensible. The crucial tenet of standard empiricism is that science must not make any permanent assumption about the nature of the universe that is upheld independently of empirical considerations, and certainly not in violation of empirical considerations. Science may accept a paradigm or hard core for a time, in the sort of way depicted by Kuhn and Lakatos, but it must not accept any such assumption permanently, independently of evidence.

Aim-oriented empiricism (AOE) is in stark conflict with standard empiricism in that it holds that science does make permanent assumptions about the nature of the universe independent of empirical considerations. Assumptions at levels 7 and 6 are, according to AOE, accepted permanently by science independently of evidence, and the even more substantial assumptions at levels 5 and 4 are accepted pretty permanently as well, and certainly not straightforwardly on the basis of empirical success, as these are untestable metaphysical theses. AOE, as a result of being in such stark conflict with standard empiricism, would be, I thought, far too heretical a view to be acceptable to any scientist.
