See also my articles summarizing aspects of the argument in various ways, where I attempt to spell out the implications of aim-oriented empiricism for science as a whole, for technological research, social inquiry, scholarship, education and global problems confronting humanity.

1. This argument was expounded in Chapter 2, section 2.3. It is taken up again in Chapter 5. For an earlier account, see). 2. For more recent discussions of diverse aspects of the problem, see, Votsis (2015), Cohen (2015), Sterkenburg (2016),, and Dasgupta (2016). 3. I exempt my own earlier work on the problem). 4. If the theory is formulated as a set of differential equations, then what is invariant throughout the possible phenomena to which the theory applies is what is asserted by the physically interpreted set of differential equations. Laws specifying precisely how diverse physical states evolve in space and time may be quite diverse in character: what matters is that they are all solutions of the same set of differential equations.

5. Counting entities is rendered a little less ambiguous if a system of M particles is counted as (a somewhat peculiar) field. This means that M particles all of the same kind (i.e. with the same dynamic properties) are counted as one entity. In the text I continue to adopt the convention that M particles all the same dynamically represent one kind of entity, rather than one entity. 6. For accounts of the locally gauge invariant structure of quantum field theories, seeFor introductory accounts of group theory as it arises in physics, seeor Jones (1990). 7. For accounts of spontaneous symmetry breaking, see, and Griffiths (1987, ch. 11). 8. This account of unity radically simplifies and improves on the account given in Maxwell (1998, chs. 3 and 4). 9. I am grateful to Jos Uffink for drawing my attention to the two objections just discussed. 10. For further discussion of simplicity, and how terminological simplicity can be related to unity, see11. For a discussion of such "approximate derivations", the conclusion being strictly incompatible with the premises, see12. See also Chapters

1. The date of my first publication arguing for aim-oriented empiricism (see2. See especially). 4. An earlier version of this chapter was delivered as a talk at a conference on "Induction, Confirmation and Science" at the London School of Economics on 10 March 2007. It was then perhaps rather more paradoxical to talk of "scientific metaphysics" than it is now, at the time ofThis is because, in recent years, as I mentioned in Chapter 2, note 8, something approaching a research industry in the philosophy of science has emerged devoted to the topic "the metaphysics of science" (see note 7 below and associated text). "Scientific metaphysics" has rather lost its paradoxical air. 5. It is widely appreciated that some metaphysical theses have influenced science in the context of discovery, in influencing scientists to try to develop certain sorts of theories, and to ignore others (see, for example,What is being argued here is very different. I argue that there are metaphysical theses, neither falsifiable nor verifiable, which are an integral part of theoretical scientific knowledge, more firmly established, indeed, than such highly corroborated theories as quantum theory and general relativity. Science is more rigorous if this is acknowledged rather than denied. All this differs dramatically even from Popper's later views concerning the important role that metaphysical research programmes play in science (seePopper held on to his demarcation criterion to the end, and never wavered from holding metaphysical theses, however scientifically fruitful, to be "unscientific" (for discussion of this point, see Chapter 4 and Maxwell, 2012).Some of this work argues for conjectural essentialism, the anti-Humean view that theoretical physics should be interpreted as seeking to discover, not just physical laws, or regularities in phenomena, but rather "necessitating properties" possessed by fundamental physical entities which determine, necessarily, that the entities in question evolve in accordance with specified laws. This is a view I argued for decades ago (see). 8. All the possible phenomena, predicted by any dynamical physical theory, T, may be represented by an imaginary "space", S, each point in S corresponding to a particular phenomenon, a particular kind of physical system evolving in time in the way predicted by T. In order to specify severely disunified rivals to T that fit all available evidence just as well as T does, all we need do is specify a region in S that consists of phenomena that have not been observed, and then replace the phenomena predicted by T with anything we care to think of. Given any T, there will always be infinitely many such disunified rivals to T. This point is inherent in Nelson Goodman's "new paradox of induction" (see, although the kind of empirically successful disunified rivals considered by Goodman in his discussion of "grue" and "bleen" are but one kind of a number of kinds of disunified theories, as we shall see in section 5.3. There is a vast philosophical literature on the underdetermination of theory by evidence.
