Furthermore, as I have argued in detail elsewhere, the arguments of this chapter, when extended to take into account, not just the implicit metaphysical assumptions of science, but its implicit value and political assumptions as well, have even more dramatic implications not just for physics or natural science, but for social science, for the humanities, for academic inquiry as a whole.

Perhaps the time has come for philosophers to take note of these arguments that have such revolutionary implications for our intellectual landscape.

Comprehensibility rather than beauty 6.1 Beauty or comprehensibility?

Many scientists, and some philosophers of science, have acknowledged that aesthetic considerations play, quite properly, an important role in influencing acceptance and rejection of theories in science, in addition to empirical considerations. A famous example is Dirac, who went as far as to declare: "It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment" (quoted in McAllister, 1996, p. 15).

The view that beauty ought to influence choice of theory in science faces, however, a serious problem. Why should beauty be a good indication of truth? Unless the truth is beautiful, and unless we have valid grounds for holding this to be the case, there can be no good reasons, it would seem, for giving preference to beautiful theories in science.

Not only may it seem dubious that we can have grounds for holding that the truth is beautiful; there may well seem to be grounds for holding that it is wildly implausible that the truth should be beautiful, especially in theoretical physics.

Whether we find something beautiful or ugly must depend, to some extent at least, on our personal, subjective, emotional responses to that thing. Aesthetic criteria have their roots deep in the human psyche, and in human culture. But physical reality, that which theoretical physics seeks to grasp, is utterly remote from the human psyche, from human culture. It may well seem utterly implausible that something as anthropomorphic, as personal, as quintessentially human and subjective, as ideas about beauty, should have anything to do with the ultimate nature of the physical universe, utterly impersonal and remote from the circumstances of human life. Beauty may seem to be the last consideration to take into account in assessing the merits of rival fundamental theories in physics.

An extremely interesting and original defence of the thesis that aesthetic considerations do quite properly influence theory choice in science has, however, been put forward recently by JamesQuite independently, I have, over a number of years, developed a view which resembles McAllister's view in a number of striking ways, but which is also different in important respects, namely aim-oriented empiricism (see Chapters 2, 4 and 5). 1 In this chapter I compare and contrast the two views. My own view, aim-oriented empiricism, has already been expounded and defended. I begin with a sketch McAllister's view. I then discuss how the two views resemble, and differ from, each other. And finally, I discuss the question of which is to be preferred.

6.2 The model of the aesthetic induction

In what follows I call McAllister's account of the role of non-empirical, aesthetic factors in the selection of theories in science "the model of the aesthetic induction" (MAI). Here, in summary, is his view.

According to MAI, the basic aim of science is to develop a body of theory that successfully predicts all observable phenomena. MAI holds that from this aim of "empirical adequacy", we can arrive at the following criteria for assessing theories: success in predicting existing empirical data, success in predicting new phenomena, consistency with other highlevel theories, explanatory power and internal consistency.

Many scientists have, however, declared that aesthetic considerations, in addition to the above, play a vital role in both the discovery and acceptance of theories in science. Dirac, Einstein and many others have stressed the importance of aesthetic considerations, such as beauty, elegance, harmony, uniformity amidst variety, simplicity, symmetry. MAI holds that such criteria do indeed have an important role to play in deciding what theories are accepted, to the extent, even, on occasions, of overriding empirical considerations.

But, according to MAI, in so far as such aesthetic considerations exercise a rational influence over choice of theory in science, two crucial points need to be borne in mind. First, theories must be considered to be abstract entities, distinct from this or that linguistic formulation. Second, what matters is not the (subjective) aesthetic judgements themselves, but rather objective, non-aesthetic properties that theories, construed as abstract entities, do actually possess, in virtue of which scientists make their aesthetic judgements.

There are, according to MAI, five classes of properties of theories that are relevant: symmetry, invocation of a model, visualizability/ abstractness, metaphysical allegiance and simplicity (related to unity). MAI stresses that many different properties fall under each of these headings. There are different kinds of symmetry; different theories have different kinds of models; some scientists, in some contexts, hold visualizability to be a virtue, while others, in other contexts, prize almost its opposite, namely abstractness; scientists have upheld different metaphysical views at different stages in the development of science, in terms of which they have sought to interpret scientific theories; and there are many different ways of assessing the simplicity of theories, yielding quite different results.
