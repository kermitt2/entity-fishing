The first point of view is obvious: the theory must not contradict empirical facts.  The second point of view is not concerned with the relation to the material of observation but with the premises of the theory itself, with what may briefly but vaguely be characterized as the "naturalness" or "logical simplicity" of the premises (of the basic concepts and of the relations between these which are taken as a basis). This point of view, an exact formulation of which meets with great difficulties, has played an important role in the selection and evaluation of theories since time immemorial. The problem here is not simply one of a kind of enumeration of the logically independent premises (if anything like this were at all unequivocally possible), but that of a kind of reciprocal weighing of incommensurable qualities  Of the "realm" of theories I need not speak here, inasmuch as we are confining ourselves to such theories whose object is the totality of all physical appearances. The second point of view may briefly be characterized as concerning itself with the "inner perfection" of the theory, whereas the first point of view refers to the "external confirmation". The following I reckon as also belonging to the "inner perfection" of a theory: We prize a theory more highly if, from the logical standpoint, it is not the result of an arbitrary choice among theories which, among themselves, are of equal value and analogously constructed.It is surely clear from this that Einstein came quite explicitly to repudiate all versions of standard empiricism towards the end of his life. There is no suggestion here that the second requirement of "inner perfection" or unity is somehow to be reduced to the first requirement of empirical adequacy: empirical considerations do not, for Einstein, alone determine choice of theory. Furthermore, Einstein has made it abundantly clear already that, in his view, in choosing only theories which satisfy the requirement of inner perfection, we are in effect assuming that the universe itself is comprehensible-this being a permanent presupposition of scientific knowledge upheld on non-empirical grounds. But in case there is any doubt on this score, here is a passage written in 1950 in which the thesis that there can be no knowledge without the presupposition that the universe is comprehensible is explicitly affirmed:

It is of the very essence of our striving for understanding that, on the one hand, it attempts to encompass the great and complex variety of man's experience, and that on the other, it looks for simplicity and economy in the basic assumptions. The belief that these two objectives can exist side by side is, in view of the primitive state of our scientific knowledge, a matter of faith. Without such faith I could not have a strong and unshakable conviction about the independent value of knowledge.I conclude that Einstein came close to articulating aim-oriented empiricism towards the end of his life, even if he did not recognize that this position is required to solve the problem of induction, and did not appreciate that it provides a more rational conception of science than does standard empiricism-and not a less rational conception, as Einstein's references to "faith" and "miracle-creed" tend to suggest.

In the end, however, what really matters is the philosophy of science implicit in Einstein's scientific deeds. Einstein himself held this view. As he put it: "If you want to find out anything from the theoretical physicists about the methods they use, I advise you to stick closely to one principle: don't listen to their words, fix your attention on their deeds"). As we have seen above, in order to make rational sense of Einstein's scientific judgements and deeds it is essential to see them from the standpoint of aim-oriented empiricism. More important, Einstein can be said to have invented aim-oriented empiricism in scientific practice during the course of discovering the special and general theories of relativity. His success in discovering these theories owes much to the invention and exploitation of the rational method of discovery of aim-oriented empiricism. This aspect of Einstein's work transformed the whole character of subsequent theoretical physics. Einstein's contributions to theoretical physics are intimately interrelated with his contribution to the philosophy of physics: after Einstein, indeed, physics and philosophy of physics ought to form one integrated discipline-aim-oriented empiricist natural philosophy. The various versions of standard empiricism defended by Popper, van Fraassen and Fine (and most contemporary philosophers of science) all fail to do justice to this vital dimension of Einstein's contribution to science. Indeed, advocacy of standard empiricism after Einstein amounts in itself to a failure to understand an important aspect of Einstein's contribution to science.

Non-empirical requirements scientific theories must satisfy: simplicity, unity, explanation, beauty *

4.1 The problem

A scientific theory, in order to be accepted as a part of theoretical scientific knowledge, must be sufficiently:

(1) empirically successful; (2) empirically contentful; (3) simple, unified, explanatory, beautiful, elegant, harmonious, nonad hoc, conceptually coherent, invariant, symmetrical, organic, inwardly perfect, non-aberrant (all terms used in this context by scientists and philosophers of science).
