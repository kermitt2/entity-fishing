With some possible exceptions, these forms are bound, occurring as prefixes with either nominal or verbal roots. Exceptions include Adang  e and Klon ge 3gen.At this stage, we remain agnostic as to whether the pAP genitive was a free or bound form. Other free pronouns vary in their form across the modern AP languages and cannot be reconstructed to pAP (

The reflexes of medial *g are much more varied, but they are robustly attested in 'yellowKui is *g retained unchanged in medial position. In Western Pantar we find the expected geminate in all forms except bagai 'crocodile', which may be a borrowing from Kaera. In Teiwa medial *g is reflected as a pharyngeal fricative, while in Abui it is reflected as a glottal fricative. Other languages reflect either a glottal stop, a liquid, a fricative, or zero. However, medial reflexes in Sawila and Wersing are supported by only one lexical item each.

The evidence for *g in final position is extremely weak. In the modern languages final g occurs only in the Pantar languages Teiwa and Kaera (as well as Sar, not in our sample). In our 400-item wordlist, final g is found in only eleven distinct Teiwa word forms. None of these has cognates in a central or easternAlor language. Cognates with Pantar and western Alor languages do exist; however, in many cases the correspondence is between medial g and final g. For example, Teiwa miag, Nedebang miagi, Kaera miag 'yesterday'; and Teiwa bog, Nedebang boga, Western Pantar boga 'young'. Hence, it seems plausible to conclude that Teiwa and Kaera final g actually derive from medial *g and that pAP *g was not found in final position.

2.2 Voiceless stops

We reconstruct three voiceless stops in labial, apical, and velar positions. While all the modern languages have glottal stops, as in Adang aha 'to cry' versus aha 'jungle', we do not find sufficient evidence at this time to reconstruct glottal stop to pAP. In initial and medial positions pAP *p remains unchanged in all the languages except Kamang, where it weakens to /f/; Western Pantar, where it predictably geminates in medial position; and Wersing, where evidence from a single correspondence ('pierce') suggests that *p was lost in medial position. Correspondence sets reflecting *p include 'hold', 1pl.incl, 'scorpion', 'pierce', and 'search'. Thus, pAP *p{i,u}nV > Teiwa pin, Blagar pina, Adang puin, Abui pun, Kamang fun, Sawila puni 'hold'. The devoicing of *b in Sawila and Wersing results in merger of *b and *p. Note that Western Pantar par 'scorpion' must be a loan from a language which preserves final *r. We find no evidence to support reconstruction of *p in final position. Rather, final /p/ in modern languages results from loss of final vowels (e.g., *tapai > Teiwa tap 'pierce', *habi > Western Pantar hap 'fish').

In initial and medial positions *t remains unchanged in all languages, with the exception of Western Pantar, which has a geminate medially as expected. The reconstruction of initial *t is supported by correspondence sets for 'recline', 'saltwater', 'short', 'stand', 'ripe', 'far' and 'tree'. Reconstruction of medial *t is supported by correspondence sets for 'dry', 'maize', 'hearth', and 'hand/arm'. Reflexes of 'dry' and 'hearth' are not sufficiently widely distributed to justify reconstruction at the level of pAP. The set for 'dry' is found only in the Pantar Strait and Central Alor languages, while the form for 'hearth' is found only in the Pantar languages. As stated earlier, we don't reconstruct pAP 'maize' since it is known to be a late borrowing from Austronesian. The resemblance between pAP *-tan 'hand/arm' and Malay taan 'hand' is superficial only and cannot be taken to indicate that the AP lexemes are Austronesian borrowings. The form taan for 'hand' is a lexical innovation of Malayic and cannot be reconstructed to higher levels of the Austronesian family: proto-Malayo-Polynesian (and protoAustronesian) reconstructions are *lima for 'hand' and *baRa for 'arm', and it is 60 2 The internal history of the Alor-Pantar language family reflexes of these proto-lexemes for 'hand' and 'arm' which are found in the Austronesian languages surrounding the AP languages. Malay has only been present in the region since the historical period, and Malay influence on the AP languages might have started as late as the beginning of the twentieth century.As such, we unproblematically reconstruct pAP *tan 'hand/arm'.

Final *t is preserved in all languages except Adang, where it is lost. The reconstruction of final *t is supported by cognate sets for 'leg', 'flea', 'betel vine', and 'wound'. However, only in Teiwa, Kaera, Blagar, and Kui does the reflex of *t still occur finally. This leads to some uncertainty as to whether these forms may have been originally medial. The correspondence set for 'betel vine', for example, as it is reflected as medial t in more than half of the modern languages. We tentatively reconstruct this form with final *t based on two pieces of evidence. First, the Western Pantar form meta does not reflect gemination, which would be expected as a reflex of medial *t. Second, several of the languages have a long vowel or diphthong. We thus reconstruct *mait and presume a process of palatalization following a high front vowel. Thus, *t > t/Vi_ in Adang, *t > h /Vi_ in Klon (presumably via s), and *t > s/ Vi_ in
