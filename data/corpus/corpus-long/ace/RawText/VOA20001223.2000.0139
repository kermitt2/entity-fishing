 Reformist allies of Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica have scored a decisive victory in today's Serbian parliamentary elections. The Democratic opposition of Serbia, which supports the President, estimates it has won 65% of the vote. The coalition took power after a popular uprising ousted long time Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in October. Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party and its allies won about 1/5th of the vote.
