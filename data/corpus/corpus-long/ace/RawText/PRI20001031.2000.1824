David Chezan reports.   Survivors from the Singapore Airlines flight described how the plane was taxing down the runway when there was a loud noise and the aircraft split in two. An American passenger said he had almost decided not to board the plane because of what he called unbelievable wind and rain. Survivors described how the tail section turned over several times, leaving passengers hanging by their safety belts, some were quickly engulfed by flames. One survivor described saying a man, as he put it, "lit up like a torch." "Flames shot up right next to me and there was jet fuel all over the place," he said. David Chezan, BBC News.
