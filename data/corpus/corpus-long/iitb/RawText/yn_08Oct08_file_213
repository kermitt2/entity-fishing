It’s a pretty good bet that most of us have not been in the fields walking and keeping our bodies in shape for the rigors of hunting since last season. One of my favorite ways to get in early preseason exercise is to head to the location that I am planning to hunt this fall. By doing this, I also can get in some important preseason scouting of the area to see how conditions are for the species I will be hunting. This is a great way to get the edge on other hunters that might use the area and also get the information needed to locate the game and find out their habits. When you get to your location, start out the same way you would if you were going on an actual hunt. Follow the same routines and see if you come across any game. Walk the trails and fields and make mental notes of the terrain as you are going along. One of the most important things is not to start out too fast. Those muscles in the legs and back usually aren’t in top condition after a long summer of non-exertion. Walk at a pace that is slower than you normally would until you feel your body loosening up a bit. After that, try to increase your pace for a short time and then go back to your original slower pace. It never is a good idea to push yourself too hard those first few times walking over un-even terrain. As you are walking through the woods or fields, make it a point to zig and zag just as you would during a real hunt. By doing a dry run on your natural hunting maneuvers, you will again make them second nature to your body. Another trick that will give you more stamina is to find a piece of wood comparable to the rifle or shotgun you will be carrying and carry it along with you. This will effectively give you more strength in your arms for the real firearm. This might sound a bit odd, but it works. A 2x4 approximately 40 inches long will provide the bulk and weight that is close to a firearm used in hunting. Also, if you are planning to get a new pair of hunting boots for the coming season, get them now and wear them on your mock hunting excursion. This will help you break them in for future use. Be sure to wear the same type of socks you will be wearing on the hunt. One last thing to not forget is your dog if you have one for bird hunting. Like us, our pets will benefit greatly from some pre-season exercise. When taking your dog out for the first time, make sure you bring some extra water to keep it well hydrated. You will find that they too will be tired after that first trip into the woods or field.
