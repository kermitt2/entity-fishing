Retailers By Name/Topic «   » October 6th, 2008, 11:57 am · · posted by HANG NGUYEN If Forever 21 is successful in its bid to buy about 150 Meryvn’s stores, could O.C. get a Forever 21 shop spanning roughly 80,000 square feet? “Most definitely,” Christopher Lee, senior vice president and head of mergers and acquisitions for Forever 21 said Monday. He envisioned at least one O.C. Mervyn’s store converting into a Forever 21 store. Mervyn’s stores average 80,000 square feet.  Forever 21 essentially wants to buy the stores that Mervyn’s isn’t closing. The department store, which has filed for bankruptcy protection, is currently closing 26 stores, including four in O.C. To find out where, . Including the stores its shuttering, Mervyns has at least 13 locations in Orange County. Lee said Forever 21 plans to sell, shutter or convert the Mervyn’s stores into Forever 21 shops. When Forever 21 expanded its Westfield MainPlace store in Santa Ana last November, it was the county’s largest Forever 21 store at 14,000 square feet. In 2010, Forever 21 plans to open a 90,000-square-foot shop in Times Square in New York, Lee said. He added that if it buys Mervyn’s stores, there will be an opportunity for former Mervyn’s employees to work at Forever 21 stores. (Photo from Forever 21 .)

Meg Says: Forever 21 jeans cost about $20.00…. cat Says: Forever 21 stinks! Their clothes fall apart! How can they open a store when Mervyns is closing? Barb Says: The clothes from stores like this normally do fall apart quickly. They are not worth the money at all. jz16 Says: I hope not! There is alot of us that are over 50 and no style or place to go. If not Mervyn’s we need a Company that can have things for us, not trying to be 20 and maybe AA and wide in shoes. I am thinking you are missing your market or they did! caseclosed Says: At forever 21, is 21 the age or the IQ of the people that buy at the store? They sell mostly overpriced junk.
