RODRIGUEZ STAR-TELEGRAM ARCHIVES/ RICHARD W. RODRIGUEZ Most-read stories Most e-mailed stories Food news & notes Blue Mesa is throwing a birthday party — five of ’em, actually — to celebrate 20 years in the Fort Worth and Dallas market. Starting at 5 p.m. Oct. 14, each of the five Metroplex Blue Mesas will be offering signature dishes such as adobe pie, red-chile salmon, churrascaritas skewers and goat cheese enchiladas — free. You just have to pay for the margaritas; it’s a cash bar. Choose from more than 100 tequilas and party down. Fort Worth’s LightCatcher Winery plans a "Wine, Dine & Dance" evening Sunday, with dinner seatings starting at 5:30 p.m. and music 6-9 p.m. There’s no admission charge beyond the cost of dinner; guitarist Tony Hakim’s band will provide music for dancing under the candlelit pavilion.
