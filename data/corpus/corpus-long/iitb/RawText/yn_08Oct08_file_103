Chippewa Falls Police Chief Wayne Nehring said Stephen C. Hryniewiecki, 37, was booked and released Monday for stealing the solid copper balls from TTM Technologies. His wife, Rita D. Hryniewiecki, 31, also faces possible charges for receiving stolen goods, Nehring said. "It's stock copper in the form of 2-inch balls" about the size of a trailer hitch, Nehring explained. Each ball is worth $5 to $6. Police Lt. Mark Hanson said Rita Hryniewiecki reportedly brought 147 pounds of copper balls to a salvage yard in Eau Claire Sept. 8 and was given $404. She returned Sept. 17 with another 97 pounds of copper balls and was given $267, Hanson said. When Rita Hryniewiecki attempted to sell 363 pounds of copper balls on Monday, the scrap yard contacted the Eau Claire Police Department, Hanson said. According to police, Rita Hryniewiecki admitted that her husband was taking the copper balls from work over a period of time. A Chippewa Falls police officer interviewed Stephen Hryniewiecki, who also allegedly admitted to stealing the copper. He was arrested Monday afternoon for theft. Nehring said the police reports will be referred to the district attorney's office for possible charges. The value of all the copper was $1,506, Hanson said. The copper Rita Hryniewicki brought Monday to the scrap yard was returned to TTM. TTM Technologies, 234 Cashman Drive on the east side of Chippewa Falls, uses the metal while making printed circuit boards, a component in the electronics industry. Nehring was pleased that the scrap yard questioned the large volume of copper balls. "The scrap company did their job and called law enforcement," Nehring said. "It means they are taking the scrap metal theft seriously." Vetter can be reached at 723-0303 or chris.vetter@ecpc.com.
