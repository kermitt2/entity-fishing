Dillen Bloomgren was pronounced dead at St. Joseph's Hospital in Dickinson, of a gunshot wound to the head, authorities said. Dunn County Deputy Glen Gietzen said the boys were hunting with their two other brothers and their father during the state's youth pheasant season when the shooting happened Sunday afternoon, north of Gladstone. "A pheasant flew up and the older brother went to get it, and he ran in front of his brother, who was shooting at another pheasant," Gietzen said Monday. > Officials say boy killed while hunting Comments okay... wrote on Oct 7, 2008 8:06 PM: " This is not a reason to panic and lock everything up!
