(Video still courtesy CNN) SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) - "Barack Obama" loses -- in Brazil. At least eight "Barack Obamas" who were running in Brazilian local elections have lost. Brazilian law allows candidates to put any name on the ballot as long as it isn't offensive. This time around, a number of candidates chose "Barack Obama." One of those candidates was running for mayor in a town on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. He says the name of the American presidential contender opened doors for him. But official election records show he didn't get a single vote. Maybe he should have tried "John McCain." Copyright 2008 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
