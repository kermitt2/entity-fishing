The conflict between Morales, the impoverished countrys first Indian leader, and governors demanding more autonomy and opposed to his anti-capitalist and pro-Indian reforms sparked clashes in which at least 19 people were killed, most of them Morales supporters. The unrest shook four provinces run by rightist politicians where anti-Morales groups raided public buildings, attacked energy facilities and blocked roads. Meanwhile, Morales announced on Sunday that general elections would be moved up a year-and-a-half to June 2009, a change decried by the opposition as a ploy to keep the ruling socialist government in power. I would estimate - and Ill say it up front without the least fear - that (the elections) will be in June, said Morales at a meeting of socialist leaders in the central city of Cochabamba.
