  Text Size Quad City Economy Appears Strong Updated: How is the economic crisis affecting you? There's been so much talk of banks in trouble and loans being denied, we decided to ask a local expert. John Anderson is the President and CEO of Quad City Bank and Trust. He says if you were not in financial trouble a few months ago, you shouldn't have much to worry about. "If you've had good credit in the past and you've been able to maintain the credit rating, you'll be able to access credit today without much trouble. There shouldn't be many changes." In fact, this past week, TV-6 has been checking on loans, jobs, small businesses and the housing market. It turns out, everyone we talked to has been very positive, and most say they're not seeing any problems, here. Despite what's going on in other parts of the country, the economy in the Quad Cities appears to be strong.
