Posted by: Brian Babyface on October 7, 2008 at 21:37:00 I think this movie will appeal to Sin City lovers. The trailer shows this is not a Palin seeker, so probably it won't suck dry from a2m at the boffice! Posted by: Ben on October 7, 2008 at 21:37:17 This is nothing whatsoever like Sin City... Posted by: Brian Babyface on October 7, 2008 at 21:39:31 Oh, and it also must not be using any own hand!

Posted by: j on October 7, 2008 at 21:54:37 It looks like The Crow and Constantine combined! I'll be seeing W. that weekend. This is a sure rental, while I have enjoyed the trailers I just dont think its gonna be that good. The running time is like 97 minutes which to me means it is mostly going to be shootem ups and will lack character development, minor thing to me is that its PG-13 which from the trailers makes me think it will feel watered down and not realistic, also IT LOOKS LIKE A TOTAL CGI FEST! Posted by: Sarah Palin on October 7, 2008 at 22:10:49 looks great hope movie is as good as all the others. Posted by: Skull Skar on October 7, 2008 at 22:16:38 The graphic novel on the site is awesome, I think this movie is going to be great, I hope they keep the original Max Payne theme (the trailer music is good though) Posted by: Brian Babyface on October 7, 2008 at 22:30:42 This movie won't need to force some backdoor entrance style after Sin City! It may gush the audiences with a golden rain of CGI SFX in their faces! And by the time it is over they would all feel relieved, much more relax, no stress! Let us hope for the best... to see some good use of bullet-time in a non retarded way like in the Matrix or slomo porn!

Posted by: john on October 7, 2008 at 23:06:41 definitely not a rental. ill be seeing this in theaters cant wait till it comes out. Posted by: Dr. Doc on October 7, 2008 at 23:17:31 this will either be really good or really really stupid the fact that Shawn Ryan was involved is a huge plus because The Shield is so awesome and is one of the Greatest cop shows of all time Posted by: Moviegoer on October 7, 2008 at 23:26:39 My favorite shot is when the Thug goes, "What are you? Some kind of cop?" and Payne goes, "Not tonight." Posted by: Undiscovered Comics Writer on October 7, 2008 at 23:31:46 they REALL should not have gone with the supernatural aspect. STICK WITH THE GAME STORYLINE! Now the story is TOTALLY unrealistic! Posted by: nelson on October 7, 2008 at 23:40:39 are you dumb its not real its not real its drug induced it says it in the ****ing script all demons are from drug induced person's POV Posted by: Paul Rox on October 7, 2008 at 23:59:36 It's PG-13!?!? WTF - even the game was rated M! It should be a decent flick, but I doubt that Wahlberg will have the same dry sense of humor that the game Max does. Posted by: Sean L. on October 8, 2008 at 02:08:53 I am not at all seeing a similarity to Sin City. I'm not sure where some of these guys are getting that from. The guy who said it looks like a Crow/Constantine mix pegged it. Only the actual film will tell though. I never even played the game, but I like the style and the suggested storyline. I'm in.
