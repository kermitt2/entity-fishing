I'm not that girly. When a bunch of women get together for a bachelorette party, it's girly heaven. And in "The Ex List," the new CBS drama starring girly girl Elizabeth Reaser (formerly of girly girl hangout "Grey's Anatomy"), the bachelorette party goes to ... a psychic! What a wild idea! Can you imagine all the shrieking? » Bella Bloom (Elizabeth Reaser, left), wants to believe, and the psychic (Anne Bedian) wants her money, in "The Ex List" on CBS. Courtesy of CBS 'The Ex List' When: 9 p.m. Friday Network: CBS The psychic tells Reaser's Bella that she has to get married in a year, or she never will. So Bella, who previously never cared about getting married, swear to God, goes on a quest to rediscover Mr. Right. Because she's already met the guy, says the psychic. And of course, immediately after this, everything else the psychic said starts coming true, so there's your show. Your show, anyway. I'll be as far away as possible - probably watching my "Robot Chicken" DVDs, or something similarly ungirly.
