Morales and the four regional leaders also failed to set a date to resume their dialogue, according to Bolivia's minister for rural development Carlos Romero. The meeting Sunday - the third between the parties in eight months - took place in Cochabamba in the centre of the country, in the presence of observers from the United Nations and regional organisations. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, has struggled to assert his authority over the wealthy eastern half of the country where rebel governors have fought for autonomy and against a new constitution. Dialogue froze between the two sides some eight months ago and violence has flared again in recent weeks in the divided country, the poorest in South America, raising fears of civil war. Morales and governors from the regions of Santa Cruz, Beni, Tarija and Chuquisaca have received a report from technical working groups which have been trying since September 18 to find a solution to the crisis. - AFP/yb Other world News • • • • • • • • • • • • Advertisements Affiliate Sites: | | | Copyright © MediaCorp Pte Ltd.
