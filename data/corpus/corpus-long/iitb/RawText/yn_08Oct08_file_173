"Siguro I'm going to go into hiding temporarily," Zamora told reporters this afternoon. Zamora's chief of staff - Robert Delano - was gunned down by three unidentified armed men at 8:20 a.m. while he was about to go to the office aboard a Toyota Frontier with a plate number 8. Doctors at the Delgado Clinic said he expired at 9:45 a.m. Zamora said he will likewise seek additional security while the investigation is ongoing. He is currently flanked by policemen from the Quezon City Police Station 6. But Zamora quickly dismissed thoughts he could have been the target of the ambush since he is on his last term as congressman. "Hindi ako makapaniwala na ako," he said, saying there are other possible motives for the killing. Zamora said Delano is the president of the association of chiefs of staff of congressmen, which had been fighting for the rights of chiefs of staff for representation and travel allowance (RATA). Zamora said he is looking for an unsigned "white paper" circulated among House employees about a month ago complaining of the House leadership and the lack of allowances for chief of staffs. The lawmaker said Delano had expressed his fear that the "white paper" may be attributed to him (Delano) being the chiefs of staff association's president. "[Delano told me] Merong white paper dito na kumakalat, di kaya ako ma-accuse nito?" said Zamora. Zamora said he would offer a reward for anyone who can give him a copy of the document, saying he has not read it himself. He said he has also asked the police to look into Delano's phone records, saying that while he and Delano were biking in Pulilan, Bulacan yesterday, Delano talked lengthily on the phone with someone Zamora does not know. Earlier in the day, Speaker Prospero Nograles said the House will do everything to help solve the case. "We will do everything within our power to get to the bottom of the incident. We will make sure that Rep. Way Kurat will be amply protected by the House," Nograles said. "We will help police investigation and we will help the congressman in case he needs more security," added Nograles in a text message sent to GMANews.TV - GMANews.TV Articles » » » » Media Video » 2008-10-08 18:45:05 » 2008-10-08 14:43:37 » 2008-10-08 12:42:35 » 2008-10-08 12:40:01 Links ADVERTISEMENT SEARCH GMANEWS.TV » All Article Video Photo | | | | | | 1223463434.492 All Rights Reserved. 2007 © GMA Network Inc.
