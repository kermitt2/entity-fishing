The processing locations allow residents affected by Hurricane Ike to fill out Right of Entry (ROE) forms, which allow the Corps’ temporary roofing specialists to enter private property. As Bonnie Buchanan, the deputy press secretary for Congressman Kevin Brady, stated, an ROE “must be signed to give the Army Corps of Engineers permission to enter your property.” The installation and materials are free to those who register and it is considered a priority mission. “The program provides assistance to storm victims in disaster areas through the installation of rolled plastic sheeting on damaged roofs, thereby helping to protect property and allowing residents to remain in their homes, reducing temporary housing costs,” stated the Corps on its website. The website goes on to state that keeping people in their homes as opposed to in hotels “returns workers to their place of employment [and] gets the local economy moving in a positive direction.” The Operation Blue Roof sign up center in Liberty County is in Liberty at the football stadium, which is located at 1200 Bowie. The center in Conroe is located at the Home Depot at 1341 W. Davis Street off Hwy. 105. According to the Corps’ website, the centers are generally open seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., although some centers may be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Corps advises residents to call 1-888-766-3258, 1-888-ROOFBLU, for locations and hours of sign-up centers and information regarding what the Corps uses to determine eligibility.
