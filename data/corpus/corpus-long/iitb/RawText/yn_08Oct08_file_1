A joint patrol had come under attack with sniper fire, machine guns and heavy weapons from militants in multiple locations, the statement said. "The combined forces responded with small arms and RPG ( rocket-propelled grenade ) fire as well as close air support , killing the militants," it said. "Afghan National Security Forces and coalition forces killed 43 militants in Qalat district, Zabul province, October 5," it said. It was one of the heaviest tolls reported in days in regular clashes between Afghan and international security forces and militants said to be from the Taliban movement and other extremist factions. The Taliban were removed from government in a US-led invasion that started with air strikes launched exactly seven years ago.
