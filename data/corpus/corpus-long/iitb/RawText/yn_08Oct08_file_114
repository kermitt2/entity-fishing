Published on Monday, October 06, 2008 Soldiers accused in murder to make first court appearance A staff report ADVERTISEMENT Two Fort Bragg soldiers accused of killing the wife of one of them are scheduled to appear in Cumberland County District Court today. Sgt. Richard David Smith, 26, and Pfc. Matthew Wayne Kvapil, 18, are charged with first-degree murder and conspiring to commit first degree murder. Fayetteville police say the men plotted to kill Smith’s wife, Sgt. Christina Smith, 29, also a Fort Bragg soldier. Christina Smith was stabbed in the neck Tuesday night as she and her husband were taking a walk on Baxter Street near their home at 751 Ashfield Drive in north Fayetteville. She died on the way to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center. Richard Smith initially told police the couple was ambushed and the attacker fled. He later admitted luring his wife to the area where Kvapil was hiding, police said. Today’s hearing is scheduled to begin between 2 and 2:30 p.m. at the Cumberland County Detention Center.
