    Bossano will tell UN that Spanish claim is OUT and Gibraltar's self-determination is IN In his presentation to the United Nations Fourth Committee, Leader of the Opposition, Joe Bossano, will build on position he adopted at Bandung Seminar and followed up subsequently by him in June at the hearing before the Committee of 24 ("C24") in New York. It must be recalled that in considering the question of Gibraltar, ie its decolonization, the Fourth Committee will have before it the report of the C24 and the record of the debates that occurred in Indonesia, says an Opposition Press release. It adds: The three principal elements of Mr Bossano's speech will be the following: ý First, the rejection of the Spanish position that Gibraltar's decolonization must come about by the application of the concept of territorial integrity instead of the inalienable right of Self Determination; ý Second, the inconsistency of the United Kingdom in both rejecting the Spanish position yet continuing to participate fully in the work of the Fourth Committee, together with the UK's continued support for the concensus decision which recommends a bilateral negotiation with Spain in the spirit of the Brussels Process negotiating framework; and ý Thirdly, Mr Bossano will express the Opposition's support for the UN's criteria for decolonization, on the basis that the same criteria must appply in the case of Gibraltar as applies to the remaining 15 colonial territories.
