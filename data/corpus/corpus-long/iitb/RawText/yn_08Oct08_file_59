    news Wednesday, Oct 08 2008 The 'Big Brother' council who set the dogs on the kennels... sending 12 officials to check on one pet By Last updated at 8:48 AM on 08th October 2008 Dog day: The local council sent 12 officials to Craig Walsh's farm in Worcester and raided the offices Not many farms offering luxurious accommodation have been raided because of claims that they are overcrowded with dogs. But then Lucies Farm is no ordinary establishment. It offers ý50-a-night accommodation for man's best friend, including acupuncture from a vet, massages and an indoor pool for doggy paddles. But its tranquility was shattered after 12 council officials raided the kennels, which are licensed to keep ten dogs, while just one pet was staying there. Acting on a tip-off, the team from two local authorities, operating under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, entered the home of owners Craig and Marjorie Walsh on the site and seized computer files containing personal details. In their trawl for evidence, they took personal medical histories, credit card information and even a list of jewellery drawn up for the couple's insurers. The raid took place on January 10 while Mr and Mrs Walsh were away. After a seven-month investigation that cost thousands of pounds, Worcestershire county council's trading standards department wrote to the couple to say it had found no wrongdoing at the kennels near Powick. Mr and Mrs Walsh, both 59, are now suing the 'council snoops' for ý150,000 over the 'Big Brother-style' raid. They are also angry that confidential personal information has been copied and will be kept by the council for a 'six-year archival period', which they say violates the Data Protection Act. Mr and Mrs Walsh are now suing the 'council snoops' for ý150,000 over the 'Big Brother-style' raid Mr Walsh said of the joint raid by Worcestershire and Malvern Hills district council: 'We have been treated like terrorists or internet paedophiles. 'My wife and I have been put through hell by two councils that believe they can ride roughshod over the interests of the people they are supposed to represent. 'We believe this was an unlawful invasion of our home without justification.' He and his wife, an author of recipe books for dogs, are suing for trespass and associated abuses of power. The councils said they were confident they had acted fully within their powers. The county council added: 'Our concern always will be for the welfare of animals and consumers using services, and it was this concern that prompted us to carry out investigations into Lucies Farm.'

So many councils need to be downsized, as can be seen, they have too many people doing pointless jobs. They are so used to suckling at the public teat, they think it is their right. Then they get bored, and imagine that they are part of the police, our lords and masters even, so they find ways to fill their days, by showing us who's boss. - Dino Fancellu, Epsom, Surrey, 08/10/2008 08:37 The councils involved claim, "Our concern always will be for the welfare of animals and consumers using services, and it was this concern that prompted us to carry out investigations into Lucies Farm." So why take personal medical histories, credit card information and a list of jewellery drawn up for the couple's insurers? This is sheer lunacy and goes way beyond what could be described as "appropriate action." I hope Mr and Mrs Walsh get their £150,000 - with costs. - Orson Ryder, BRIGHTON, East Sussex, 08/10/2008 08:29 Is it democratic or legal, that the jumped up officials from this council's trading standards department can exercise such powers? There is something seriously wrong with this countries' legal structure when this can happen to a business like this. After all, this couple are not conning the public in as big way or describing curved bananas as straight ones, so what in God's name are these interfering clots thinking of? - Graham, Preston, Lancs, 08/10/2008 07:42 **yourComments** - **name**, **townAndCountry**, **creationDate** Add your comment Your email address will not be published You have 1000 characters left.
