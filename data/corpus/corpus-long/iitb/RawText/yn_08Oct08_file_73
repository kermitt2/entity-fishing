The meeting Sunday -- the third between the parties in eight months -- took place in Cochabamba in the center of the country, in the presence of observers from the United Nations and regional organizations . Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, has struggled to assert his authority over the wealthy eastern half of the country where rebel governors have fought for autonomy and against a new constitution. Dialogue froze between the two sides some eight months ago and violence has flared again in recent weeks in the divided country, the poorest in South America , raising fears of civil war . Morales and governors from the regions of Santa Cruz , Beni, Tarija and Chuquisaca have received a report from technical working groups which have been trying since September 18 to find a solution to the crisis.
