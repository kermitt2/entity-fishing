James Meade, a veteran Iowa City pilot and flight instructor, was listed in serious condition with cuts and bruises at University of Iowa Hospitals. Iowa City, Ia. ý Engine failure probably caused a pilot to crash his plane into a residential neighborhood here Monday night, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Cessna 150 crashed through several trees and landed nose-first at about 8:15 p.m. Monday in the street in front of 1215 Edingale Lane, just north of Iowa Highway 1 and the Iowa City airport. The pilot, James Meade, 64, of Iowa City was taken to University of Iowa Hospitals, where he was listed in serious condition. Witnesses had said he was conscious, but bleeding from his head. Phillip Wolford, general manager of Jet Air, which is based at the airport, said Meade suffered mainly cuts and bruises. Meade, a flight instructor with several years of experience, is a good pilot and managed to avoid hitting any houses or vehicles when he crashed, said Michael Tharp, the airport's operations specialist. Meade was not operating on a flight plan Monday night, meaning he could have been flying either for fun or to stay current on the plane, Tharp said. The crash was the third in the city since June. The FAA is investigating. This article includes information from the Associated Press.
