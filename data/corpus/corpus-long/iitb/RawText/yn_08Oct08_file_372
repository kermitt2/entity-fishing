BY KIRSTIN MAGUIRE For 7-year-old Anthony Pierre, an ideal playground not only includes swings, water slides and monkey bars, but a pet monkey, too. He, along with about 25 other young designers from the Miami-Dade Parks after-school program, put their imaginations to the test Tuesday when they submitted drawings for a new playground at Little River Park, 10525 NW 24th Ave. Home Depot and the nonprofit community organization KaBOOM! hosted the children's design day to brainstorm what Little River Park's new playground should look like. The park, which volunteers will build in just one day on Dec. 9, is mostly funded by Home Depot, said KaBOOM! project manager Justin Fitzgerald. Little River Park will be the second Miami park playground KaBOOM! and a community sponsor have built in the past year. Volunteers helped build the playground at West Perrine Park in January. Tierra Nunes, 8, drew her playground with slides, swings and a flower garden, with four flowers in each row. ''It's fun because I never did something like this before,'' Nunes said. ``I like to see the stuff people draw for their playground.'' Although KaBOOM! and Home Depot can't make every detail of the designs a reality, they do their best to use recurring themes, such as swings, as a basis for the design. Usually the kids choose the colors, too, but this time Miami Dolphins players will help build the playground -- so the color scheme will, of course, be aqua and orange.
