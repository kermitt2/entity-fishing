Peter Clulow spent four hours suspended over London putting the finishing touches on an Air New Zealand billboard. The billboard, located on Middlesex Street, trumpets the slogan: "Is it just a kiwi thing?" and aims to promote the "can-do" attitude of New Zealanders. Mr Clulow, an Air New Zealand employee for over 35 years, said he was keen to participate in the stunt from the start. "When I was asked to do this I immediately said yes -- it sounded like a good chance to rappel off a tall building and have a bit of fun in the process," he said. The advertising ploy follows another campaign in which people were paid $1000 to shave their heads and have an Air New Zealand message temporarily tattooed in place to tell people about the changes to remove queues at domestic check-in counters.
