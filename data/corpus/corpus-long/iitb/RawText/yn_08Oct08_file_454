Augie volleyball a rising force in Northern Sun Buckley's debut season as coach highlighted by critical win over UMD matt zimmer  mzimmer@argusleader.com  October 7, 2008 Ashley Buckley's debut season as Augustana volleyball coach has its signature victory. The Vikings knocked off perhaps their biggest nemesis, Minnesota-Duluth, on Saturday at the Elmen Center. The win reinforced the fact that Augie can accomplish big things in its debut season in the Northern Sun. "That was a really exciting win for our team," said Buckley, knowing that the Vikings had lost 12 straight matches to Duluth dating back to 2000. "We'd gone so long without beating them and they're such a great team that it's really a confidence booster. We showed we can compete with the top teams out there." Augustana moves to 13-6 on the season, including 6-1 in NSIC play. That puts them in third place, behind 8-0 Concordia-St. Paul and 7-1 Southwest Minnesota State. With several winnable games coming up on the schedule, now is the time for the Vikings to make their move. "We've been talking about where we want to go," Buckley said. "We want to start peaking now and continue to go uphill. The last two weeks, we've really been on a roll. I think the girls recognize they have to continue to bring energy to be successful, and they've really stepped up to the plate." The Vikings have been well-served by strong play with and without the ball. Cayla Schroeder's 3.11 kills per game leads five players averaging at least two, while her 3.83 digs a night also leads the squad, with Jenna Hultgren (3.44), Regan Tekavec (3.02) and Beth Talcott (2.88) close behind. Senior setter Lisa Hoegh has directed the offense, totaling 821 set assists (11.4 per game). "It hasn't just been one girl or two girls," Buckley said. "It's been across the board. I'm happy with where we're at, but it's a long season." Stand by me When Ryan Grossman hit the game-winning 31-yard field goal in overtime to propel the Vikings to a 41-38 football win over Minnesota State on Saturday, it allowed the O'Gorman grad and his coaches to overlook the fact that he had four kicks blocked - two punts and two short field goals. The punts may have been due to protection issues, but the field goals appeared to simply come out too low. Coach Brad Salem acknowledged that Grossman may have aimed low due to the wind, and said kick trajectory would be addressed this week in practice. But he also expressed confidence in his senior kicker. "I told him after the last miss (a 27-yarder that was blocked near the end of regulation), 'Get ready to win the game,' and that's what he did," Salem said. "He's our kicker, and we have confidence he can do the job. He has a short memory - he's focused on the next kick." Said cornerback Jason Donnelly: "If the game comes down to (Grossman) kicking a field goal to win it, we have total confidence he can do it." Etc The No. 24 Vikings men's cross country squad will be in action this weekend at the Nebraska-Kearney invite, their last competition before the NSIC championships Oct. 25. The women - idle this week and ranked 3rd in the nation - will participate in the Chili Pepper Invitational in Fayetteville Ark., Oct. 18, their last tune up before postseason.
