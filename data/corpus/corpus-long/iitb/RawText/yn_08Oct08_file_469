The visit will be given over to energy questions, notably the production and distribution of electricity , a sector that has been in a catastrophic state for the past several years. Despite vast sums being earmarked to improve electricity generation , Nigeria, home to 140 million people , currently produces less than 3,000 megawatts, that is 15 times less than South Africa , a country with roughly three times its population size. Idrac will be accompanied by two representatives from RÃ©seau de Transport d'ElectricitÃ© (RTE), managers of France's public electricity distribution network .
