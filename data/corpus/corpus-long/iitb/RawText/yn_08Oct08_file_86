They were flown south to be closer to the freezing waters of their natural habitat on a huge air force cargo plane in what was South America's largest-ever transfer. Onlookers cheered as the young Magellanic penguins were set free on a beach in southern Brazil and scampered into the ocean, said the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Experts hope a small group of older penguins released along with the young ones will help guide them south to the Patagonia. Magellanic penguins breed in large colonies in southern Argentina and Chile and migrate north as far as southwest Brazil between March and September. Environmentalists say it is not know why the penguins were stranded so far north, but suggest they could have been carried beyond their usual range by a flow of warm water. IFAW spokesman Chris Cutter says the penguins were among nearly 1,000 that have been washed up on Brazil's north-eastern coast in recent months. About 20% of the penguins have died and the rest were not healthy enough send back.
