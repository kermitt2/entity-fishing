Reeves  dcreeves@pnj.com  October 8, 2008 When the Pensacola Junior College basketball teams get underway later this month, be sure to have an atlas handy. Between the men's and women's programs, five international players will take the floor for the 2008-09 season. "We have had kids from all over the world (before)," men's coach Paul Swanson said during PJC's basketball media day on Tuesday. "When they have a good experience here, leave here and they do well, they leave and promote us." All three international newcomers on the men's team were lured by former Pirates. Sophomore Levan Patsatsia and freshman George Jgerenaia join the program from Tbilisi, Georgia Republic, following in the footsteps of fellow Georgians Lasha Parghalava and Petras Barlocka. Both were starters for the Pirates in 2007-08 and signed to play with the University of Hawaii this season. "Lasha and Petras told those guys, 'You've got to come here, you've got to come here,'" Swanson said. Another freshman, 6-8 forward Shaun Clarke, hails from Melbourne, Australia. John White, a former PJC player under Swanson now playing professionally in Australia, recommended Clarke after seeing him play last year. Good word has traveled fast for the women's program this year as well. A native of Windsor, Canada, Sierra Highgate returns as team's starting point guard. Freshman Izzy Chillcott, has joined the Lady Pirates from Queensland, Australia. "A lot of it is word of mouth," PJC women's coach Chanda Rigby said. "Even universities are calling us because of the environment we have here at PJC, we have so many resources. There may have been a big Division I school that has been to a foreign country, see a great player and give us a call." The prestige of the Panhandle conference ý always considered one of the top three junior college basketball conferences in the nation ý attracts many players that have the talent to play Division I basketball but may have lacked the grades to qualify. PJC is also a preferred option for players transferring from four-year institutions after their freshman season. Instead of transferring to another four-year school and being forced to sit out a year per NCAA rules, players can get some competitive action for one season in junior college before graduating and choosing a new four-year program. Both Patsatsia (Univ. of Arkansas) and Payne ( Univ. of South Carolina) chose that option after spending last year at schools in the Southeastern Conference. Domestically, both teams are inundated with players from around the country. Only five players hail from the state of Florida while cities like Detroit (Christopher Clarke, Fr.), Dallas (Geneshia Dunbar, So.) and Brooklyn, N.Y. (Wykeemia Gray, Fr.) and Chicago (Paris Carter, Fr.) are represented. The 2008-09 rosters show the type of reputation PJC and its conference has in the basketball community. "We want to win every time we play, that's everyone's goal," Swanson said. "But we want to have a program where the kids leave here better in every way. They are a little bit more mature, a better player and a better student. We want to have a program that represents the school the right way."
