Suryanarayana Chamlong Srimuang SINGAPORE: A proactive leader of the opposition People’s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), Chamlong Srimuang, was arrested in Bangkok on Sunday, on charges of “treason.” This added a dimension to the unabated political crisis, with the PAD activists, occupying the Government House premises in Bangkok for nearly six weeks now, pledging to intensify their “struggle.” The PAD’s refrain is “new politics,” largely defined as a clean break from the policies and legacy of the former Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who now lives in self-imposed exile.
