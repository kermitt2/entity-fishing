The Falcons have outscored opponents 45-0 in the first quarter of its three victories, including a 27-24 win at Green Bay on Sunday. Smith also said he wants the offense to keep in mind the importance of converting third downs. Atlanta went 6-for-12 at Green Bay and would have had two more if not for dropped passes. The offense also converted two of three chances in the red zone after going a combined 0-for-5 at Carolina and Tampa Bay. Atlanta has two of the league's better playmakers. Running back Michael Turner leads NFL rushers in net yards with 543, average yards per game at 108.6 and touchdowns (six). Wideout Roddy White ranks third in yards receiving with 454 and fifth in average yards per game at 90.8. Copyright 2008 by All rights reserved.
