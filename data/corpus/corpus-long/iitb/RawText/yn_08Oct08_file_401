They will be refined in hopes to graduate Charm School as sophisticated and polite ladies. And who better to push these girls down the road to renewal and re-discovery than Sharon Osbourne. As headmistress of Charm School , Sharon will attempt to strip the girls of their former rebellious and wild ways. And with some help from experts, hopefully transform the girls into fully rockiný ladies. Weekly News Alert The entire contents of this web site are © 1995-2008 by TheCelebrityCafe.com.
