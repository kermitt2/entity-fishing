    | Nepal appoints new living goddess Last Modified: 07 Oct 2008 Source: PA News Hindu and Buddhist priests chanted sacred hymns and cascaded flowers and grains of rice over a three-year-old girl who was appointed a living goddess in Nepal. Wrapped in red silk and adorned with red flowers in her hair, Matani Shakya received approval from the priests and President Ram Baran Yadav in a centuries-old tradition with deep ties to Nepal's monarchy, which was abolished in May. The new "kumari" or living goddess, was carried from her parents' home to an ancient palatial temple in the heart of the Nepali capital, Katmandu, where she will live until she reaches puberty and loses her divine status.
