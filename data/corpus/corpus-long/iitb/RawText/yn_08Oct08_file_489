Treness estate on Orkney can only be reached by driving over a mile-long stretch of white sands. The 143-acre estate on Sanday is described as "living on the edge of the world" and is available for a bargain price of £395,000. It includes the 358-year-old Treness House, along with a courtyard of four derelict cottages. The surrounding land is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. To reach it requires either a ferry trip or a 10-minute flight from Kirkwall before driving a 4x4 around a mile across Cata Sands. The jewel in the crown is the spectacular mile-long Newark beach with its white sand dunes. Current owner John Craigie, the boss of Craigie Engineering in Kirkwall, described it as "magical". He said: "It is a wonderful spot where you are remote and yet an airstrip is only a few minutes away." David Strang-Steel, of agents Strutt & Parker, said: "It is just the most extraordinary place in Britain I have been to. "Newark beach is as good as any beach in Antigua, although you won't have quite the same weather." Share this article A PRIVATE paradise is up for sale in Scotland - complete with its own beach.
