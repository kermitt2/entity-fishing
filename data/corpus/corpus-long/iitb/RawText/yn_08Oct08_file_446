    Oktoberfest party tickets now sold out By editorial Tuesday, 30 September 2008 - 1:46pm. By Duane Hicks, Staff writer Those who waited to buy tickets for Riverside Foundation for Health Cares Oktoberfest party this Saturday are out of luck as the event sold out as of yesterday morning. But the good news is organizers will see a full house of 200-plus out for the fundraiser at the Memorial Sports Centre auditorium. We are ecstatic, said Joan Allison, chair of the Riverside Foundation for Health Cares special events committee. Everything has come together, she added. Now we just have to keep our fingers crossed that we have room to do all these games and theres room for people to move and enjoy themselves, and I am sure there will be. Theres no stress coming to this venue, she laughed. The food and games are all set. Were getting prizes lined up, noted Foundation director Teresa Hazel. Were getting lots of very nice donations for our silent auction. Were overwhelmed with the support, really. Its been incredible, she enthused. The party starts at 6 p.m., with the food stations opening at 7. Hazel said there will be an assortment of German and Bavarian cuisine (sausage, potato salad, beer cheddar soup, etc.), a cheese station, and a German chocolate and dessert bar. Entertainment will be provided by the Mud Lake City Oompah Band. As well, there will be a silent auction and penny table, while the special events committee has been planning games, including Ring Around the Rosé, a beer cap toss, poker showdown, and a Labatt Brewing Co.-sponsored Alexander Keith stein holding contest. Games cost anywhere from a toonie to $20 to play (in the case of the stein holding contest), with prizes going up in value accordingly. » Quicklinks Poll © 2008 Fort Frances Times Ltd.
