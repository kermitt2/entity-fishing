    Online edition of India's National Newspaper Monday, Oct 06, 2008 | National News: | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Advts: | | | | Trinamool leader’s violence ‘threat’ Special Correspondent KOLKATA: Leader of the Opposition and senior Trinamool Congress leader, Partha Chatterjee, reportedly called up Commissioner of Police Gautam Mohan Chakravarty on Saturday night and allegedly threatened to “set all of Bengal on fire” unless some of those arrested in connection with the violence near a city market were released, according to the police. “You are intimidating me … saying you will set all of Bengal on fire. I am recording this. Kindly do not intimidate me,” Mr. Chakravarty told Mr. Chatterjee from his mobile in the course of the conversation. The call was made after the Commissioner went to the Charu Market area from where the police arrested some persons in connection with setting ablaze of some police jeeps and attacking the local thana following a bus accident there. The prime accused is stated to be a local Trinamool leader. Mr. Chakravarty told Mr. Chatterjee that arrests would be made irrespective of party affiliation. Mr. Chatterjee took exception to the Commissioner “making public his response to a private conversation with the Leader of the Opposition.” “It is an infringement on my right to privacy and I have written to the West Bengal Governor and the Union Home Minister in this regard. This brings out in the open moves by the police to keep a close surveillance on conversations of Opposition leaders, including Ms. Mamata Banerjee,”, Mr. Chatterjee told The Hindu .
