The protests are expected to start at 4:00 pm (1600 GMT) and come two days after riot police armed with tear gas broke up several small anti-coup demonstrations by supporters of the ousted president Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi. "We expect the protests will be suppressed but that is the price to pay," Abdallahi Ould Mohamed, also known as Nanah, the leader of the CGTM union, told AFP Tuesday. On Monday the military junta, lead by General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, let pass an African Union deadline to reinstate the ousted president. The African Union has threatened to impose sanctions, and opponents of the putsch in the country called Monday on the bloc to make good on its threat against the junta, which ousted Mauritania's first democratically elected president on Aug. 6. The six unions - UTM, CGTM, CLTM, USLNM, UNTM and CNTM - who say they account for 98% of union membership in Mauritania, are opposed to the coup. The five remaining unions in the West African country support the new leadership.
