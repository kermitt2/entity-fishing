(AP) - The Conway County sheriff says a natural gas well near Center Ridge exploded today as workers apparently were trying to relieve pressure in the structure through a controlled burn. State emergency management says one worker among a crew of 6 was burned and taken to a hospital. Texas-based Southwestern Energy Company owns the well off Highway 124. The well continued to burn as firefighters and emergency workers monitored the fire. The sheriff said the burning well does not pose a health or environmental danger in the rural area where Southwestern Energy has been drilling in the underground Fayetteville Shale formation. A company spokesman did not immediately return a call for comment. Copyright 2008 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
