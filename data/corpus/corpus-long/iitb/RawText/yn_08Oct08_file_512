Posted on Wed, Oct. 8, 2008 NHL: Injured Ovechkin expected to play From Inquirer Wire Services Alex Ovechkin left practice early yesterday, but the reigning league MVP is expected to play in the Washington Capitals' season opener Friday night at Atlanta. Ovechkin skated off the ice at the team's home arena after less than 15 minutes. "He'll be OK," coach Bruce Boudreau said. "He'll be playing Friday." "You know, it's nothing serious at all, but, I mean, it would be prudent for me not to say why he went off," he said. Another Capitals forward, Alexander Semin, also missed practice time - and also is in the team's plans for Game 1. "He should be fine," Boudreau said. "Not feeling well." The team later said both players were dealing with nagging injuries. Lee goes home. Injured New York Islanders defenseman Chris Lee flew back to New York after being hospitalized overnight in Florida following a hard hit in a preseason game against the Panthers. Lee was removed on a stretcher during the third period of the Islanders' 6-0 loss Monday after being checked into the boards from behind by Rostislav Olesz. The defenseman underwent tests at Broward General Hospital and was cleared to fly home. The news wasn't all good for Lee, though. He was among seven players sent to Bridgeport of the AHL as the Islanders trimmed down to the regular-season roster limit. Still with Chicago. Goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin is expected to start the regular season with the Blackhawks. Khabibulin, 35, had seemed destined to be sent to the minors or traded, or to opt to play in his native Russia, by the time the Blackhawks open their season against the host New York Rangers on Friday night. But yesterday, Khabibulin was on general manager Dale Tallon's final roster. Chicago signed goalie Cristobal Huet to a four-year, $22.45 million contract on July 1. Tallon and coach Denis Savard said they planned to start the season with the "luxury" of two No. 1 goalies. Calgary cuts costs. The Flames placed veteran defensemen Rhett Warrener and Anders Eriksson and forward Jamie Lundmark on waivers to get below the salary cap. They are headed to the Flames' AHL Quad City affiliate in Moline, Ill., unless claimed off waivers by another club or traded. Reassigning the players put Calgary's payroll $2 million below the $56.7 million cap. McLaren cut. The San Jose Sharks put defenseman Kyle McLaren, 31, on waivers, possibly ending the oft-injured veteran's 41/2-year tenure with the club. Buzz this story.
