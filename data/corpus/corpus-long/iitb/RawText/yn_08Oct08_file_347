    NORTHWEST NEWSWEEK - TOP STORY Ignatieff brings campaign to the North TB News Source Web Posted: 10/7/2008 10:40:36 AM Deputy Leader of the federal Liberal Party stopped in Thunder Bay this past week, and Northwestern Ontario was a key focus in the campaign message. Michael Ignatieff said Canada needs a government that understands and respects its role in regional economic development. He also said the Liberal party does just that. He said the Liberals want to talk to the rail companies to see how to reinvest in rail in the region as well as increase funding for FedNor. 'And where companies need a federal loan guarantee to succeed, Thunder Bay Fine Papers being an example, but not the only example, where they have a sound business case, where they can prove this will generate jobs that will stay,' he said. 'We think the federal government should step in. We've done this in the past, and it's been successful, and we want to do that again.' Ignatieff said he doesn't think the Harper government believes in regional economic development, and he claims voting for Liberal candidates is the only way to gain leadership in Ottawa for Thunder Bay. Ignatieff is the third high-ranking Liberal to visit the city since the election was called. But he denies his visit is a sign that the Liberals are worried about losing these seats to the NDP.
