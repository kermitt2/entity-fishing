By Wendy Pan Platinum Quality Author

So, you are wanting to buy a digital camera? There are many great beginner digital cameras out there and there are also great expert digital cameras out there also. You just have to research before you buy to make sure you get what you want. If you are new to taking pictures why don't you start out with a cheap camera and get used to that camera and get to know how to use it before you step up to a higher quality camera.

Some questions to ask yourself before you choose a digital camera that is right for you:

- Do you want a thin camera or a fat camera?
- Do you want one that has a fast response time?
- Would you like digital or optical zoom?

Make sure when you go to purchase a digital camera make sure that there aren't a lot of options on the camera. That can really confuse a beginner photographer. Even if you have an instructional book it can still be rather confusing.

Check out as many stores as you want before making a decision on what you want. Stores always have some our on display for you to touch, feel and see how comfortable it is for you to hold. And that is important. You want a camera that is comfortable in your hands. While you are figuring out what camera is comfortable to you get a sales associate to help you out with any questions that you may have. Questions are important. You can ask them what the best beginner digital camera is.

Now of course you are starting out with a cheap digital camera, so it's not going to have the best quality pictures. That is okay though. Pictures are pictures. Just as long as you capture what you want to that is okay. Family and friends won't mind. They know you are a beginner.

Once you have taken your pictures you can insert your memory stick into your computer and download your pictures on the computer. You can also edit them. For instance, you can take the red eye out, crop them, adjust the brightness, etc. Once you have done that you can send your new pictures to your friends and family for them to enjoy. There are many of websites online that let you download your pictures on there site for you to stick in a photo album. Trust me it's much easier to email that way.

Now once you have taken plenty of pictures of kids, animals, landscaping, etc. and you have figured out how to use your beginner digital camera and you are doing well and feeling comfortable than it's time to move up to a bigger and better camera. Now this of course will take more than a days research online and at stores to figure out what all you want and expect out of the camera. For now though just snap as many pictures as you want and have fun with it. There is no need to rush to get a bigger and better camera yet.
