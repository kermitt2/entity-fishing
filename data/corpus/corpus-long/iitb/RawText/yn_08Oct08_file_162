But for this season, none may be bigger than Saturday's nationally-televised, primetime showdown in The Swamp against No. 4 LSU. A win Saturday would put the Gators back in the BCS title hunt, a place many envisioned Florida would find itself before its stunning 31-30 home loss against Ole Miss two weeks ago. Florida coach Urban Meyer is counting on the crowd (an expected sellout of more than 90,000) to provide an assist. LSU redshirt freshman quarterback Jarrett Lee will be making just his second career start, his first on the road. "There is no question with the (LSU home) game two years ago and the FSU game last year; the fans had a big factor on the game," Meyer said. "LSU has a first-time starter coming in here and we all know the issues with communications during a big game. It's great to be playing at home." No. 11 Florida also will look for progress from an offense that's been unable to put up the same dynamic numbers it did a season ago. The Gators are averaging 36 points per game, down from the 42.5 points per game they averaged last season. Florida offensive coordinator Dan Mullen was encouraged with the offensive balance the Gators showed in their 38-7 win last Saturday at Arkansas. Both Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey rushed for more than 100 yards, the first Florida tandem to rush for more than 100 apiece since Fred Taylor and Bo Carroll did it against Central Michigan in 1997. "We had six different guys with multiple catches and two backs over 100 yards," Mullen said. "That's the balance and distribution we want." NOTES, QUOTES SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: Florida was able to get back on track late against Arkansas, putting up 21 of its 38 points in the fourth quarter. Look for Tim Tebow to continue to try to spread the ball and establish confidence in different receivers as defenses will continue to key on Percy Harvin and Louis Murphy. Riley Cooper, Deonte Thompson and Carl Moore could see expanded roles in this game. The offensive line showed some progress against Arkansas, but will need to cut down on penalties (false starts, illegal formations, holdings) that were drive-killers through the first three quarters. SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: Florida will look to get pressure on LSU quarterback Jarrett Lee, a redshirt freshman making just his second career start. If the Gators can force Lee into some early mistakes, it could set the tone for the rest of the game. Florida will look to load defenders in the box to stop LSU Heisman-candidate running back Charles Scott and force Lee to beat them. QUOTE TO NOTE: "It's like turnovers, you address it, then you coach it, you show it on film. There is not a better group of players than our offensive line. We have a good bunch of guys that understand the value in limiting penalties. It will be corrected." Florida coach Urban Meyer, on his team being flagged 12 times for 110 yards against Arkansas. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL THIS WEEK'S GAME: No. 11 Florida vs. No. 4 LSU, Oct. 11 The nationally-televised primetime game will serve as Florida's chance to get back into BCS title contention. It's always an electric atmosphere at night at Florida Field, with a sellout of 90,000-plus expected. LSU won a tight game last season, when the Tigers were successfully grinding with Jacob Hester and made a few timely defensive plays. PLAYERS TO WATCH: QB Tim Tebow DT Ricky Jean-Francois of LSU created a stir, one Tebow noticed, with his comments to the Orlando Sentinel about how eager LSU's defense is to get after Tebow. Coaches are simply saying, Tebow will be ready. For all the numbers that Tebow has put up in an impressive career, he has yet to lead Florida to a second-half comeback. This could be the game where Florida needs Tebow to come up with a big drive in the closing minutes and silence the Bayou Bengals. WR/RB Percy Harvin Florida coach Urban Meyer generally turns to Harvin in tight games. Expect Harvin to get 10-15 carries and 5-10 balls thrown his way. Harvin has caught TD passes in each of his last three games. MLB Brandon Spikes Florida will need Spikes at his best after a subpar performance last week, because LSU comes into the game looking to establish the run with talented junior tailback Charles Scott. RB/KR Brandon James James showed more flashes of his offensive potential last week, scoring his first receiving touchdown of the season. A big play from James on special teams could end up the difference in what's projected to be a tight game. RB Chris Rainey With starting running back Emmanuel Moody questionable with a sprained ankle, Florida will likely need to turn to Rainey and true freshman Jeff Demps for some carries in the running game. Both did well against Arkansas but will face a more physical defense this time around. How they handle some big hits from LSU could determine the outcome. ROSTER REPORT RB Kestahn Moore (pulled hamstring) is expected back Saturday against LSU. LB Ryan Stamper (ankle sprain) also is expected back for LSU. LG Marcus Gilbert (ankle sprain) should be back for the LSU game after sitting out against Arkansas. RB Emmanuel Moody (ankle sprain) is questionable for LSU. OG Jim Tartt is questionable with a sprained shoulder. LB Dustin Doe (double-hernia) won't be back until at the earliest the Oct. 25 matchup against Kentucky, which comes after a bye week. _____________________________________________________________ GEORGIA INSIDE SLANT The off week came at a good time for No. 10 Georgia. The Bulldogs needed the breather to rest injured players, including running back Knowshon Moreno, and they needed time to mentally get over their deflating 41-30 home loss to Alabama. Moreno's elbow has healed and he'll be in the lineup when Tennessee visits on Saturday. The Volunteers are struggling at 2-3, but the Bulldogs won't have trouble finding motivation. In addition to redeeming themselves for the Alabama debacle, the Bulldogs want payback for last year's 35-14 defeat in Knoxville. Coach Mark Richt knows Tennessee is plenty capable despite the Vols' offensive woes. '"I certainly don't want to paint a picture that we've got it all together and they don't, because I don't think that is the case," Richt said. "What I'm most concerned about is, can we put it together and rebound from our last ball game?" NOTES, QUOTES SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: The Bulldogs are averaging 34.4 points and 425 total yards, but still must get more consistent play from their young offensive line. If that happens, QB Matthew Stafford, RB Knowshon Moreno and freshman WR A.J. Green will be impossible to stop. Georgia is converting 47 percent of its third downs, second-best in the ACC. SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: The Bulldogs are giving up 224 yards per game through the air. But Tennessee is not likely to exploit that weakness. Georgia is stingy against the run (62 yards per game), thanks in part to incomparable LB Rennie Curran. Georgia allows opponents to convert 33 percent of their third downs, which ranks seventh in the SEC. QUOTE TO NOTE: "(Tennessee is) trying to get the right quarterback, but everywhere else they look like the rest of our league." coach Mark Richt on the struggling Volunteers. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL THIS WEEK'S GAME: Tennessee at No. 10 Georgia, Oct. 11 The Bulldogs try to rebound from a humiliating home loss to Alabama two weeks ago. In getting the ship righted, Georgia hasn't forgotten another loss to the Volunteers, 35-14 in Knoxville last year. With redshirt sophomore QB Nick Stephens getting his second start for the Vols, the Bulldogs' defense is licking its chops. Tennessee leads the SEC in total defense and will provide a stiff test to Georgia's high-powered offense. PLAYERS TO WATCH: RB Knowshon Moreno The electric sophomore is vowing to play despite injuring his elbow against Alabama. He is averaging 98 yards rushing per game and has scored 10 touchdowns. QB Matthew Stafford The strong-armed junior is coming off his first poor outing. He threw his first interception of the season against Alabama. Look for a bounce-back effort from Stafford, who is averaging 239 passing yards per game and has tossed seven touchdowns. LB Rennie Curran The Vols will try to pound the ball, and Curran has been involved in several high-impact collisions. He leads the Bulldogs with 43 tackles, 23 more than any other player, and six tackles for loss. ROSTER REPORT: Starting MLB Dannell Ellerbe, who sprained his knee against Alabama, is questionable for Saturday's game against Tennessee. DE Roderick Battle will miss his fourth straight game with a neck injury. Brannan Southerland, who played only on special teams against Alabama, will return to his primary job as fullback. The senior standout missed the four games following foot surgery. Sophomore WR Tony Wilson was on crutches this week due to a chronic ankle injury and might undergo season-ending surgery. _____________________________________________________________ KENTUCKY INSIDE SLANT Steve Spurrier has never lost to Kentucky. The Head Ball Coach will put that streak on the line when he leads South Carolina into Commonwealth Stadium Saturday for an SEC East showdown with Rich Brooks' Wildcats. "This is a huge game for us if we want to be a factor in the SEC race," said Brooks. "We just need to step up and with the help of our fans hopefully we can get back on track and play better. We did not play well last week and we need to get better." Kentucky (4-0, 1-0 SEC) tested No. 2 Alabama last week, closing to within a field goal with under a minute to play. But the Wildcats misplayed several opportunities and ended up with their first loss of the season. South Carolina, on the other hand, is coming off an impressive win at Ole Miss. The Gamecock offense had its best performance of the season. Under the direction of quarterback Chris Smelley, South Carolina put up 31 points. The Wildcats are not entering the game at full strength and will be throwing out a makeshift offensive line, possibly missing four key players, against South Carolina's stingy defense. "You have to be assignment-sound," said Brooks. "You have to communicate those things at the line of scrimmage because the blocking assignment is going to change depending on the front. So if you're not prepared against that front, then you aren't going to be able to block that front. Yeah, it's a problem." NOTES, QUOTES SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: Coach Rich Brooks joined Steve Spurrier and Urban Meyer in pointing out that the new clock rules are reducing the number of plays per game. Brooks said it's also been a factor in his team's play-calling. "I would like to run more too, but we already discussed earlier this year that there are fewer plays in college football," said Brooks Monday. "Certainly, when your opponent is running the football and running the clock it makes it difficult to have a lot of snaps. I think that I would like to be 50/50 but we weren't in that position because we were not moving the ball on the ground (against Alabama)." SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: Alabama rushed for 282 yards against Kentucky. But the stats are deceiving. Seventy-eight of those yards came on one first-quarter touchdown run by Glen Coffee. Plus, the Wildcats were missing top tackler Micah Johnson and got limited action from tackle Ricky Lumpkin. Yet, as the game wound down, it was Alabama that looked more drained, not the depleted Wildcat defense. QUOTE TO NOTE: "Unfortunately for us, we are looking at a South Carolina team that looks like they got their act together last week (vs. Ole Miss). I thought that (Chris) Smelley had a very good game. Offensively, I think that they had their best game of the year on the road against a team that had just beaten Florida the week before." coach Rich Brooks. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL THIS WEEK'S GAME: South Carolina at Kentucky, Oct. 11 It isn't the game it was on paper last year, but the outcome could sway the momentum for both teams. The Wildcats and Gamecocks were both ranked in the top 10 in last year's meeting, a 38-23 South Carolina win. Kentucky has never beaten a Steve Spurrier-coached team. PLAYERS TO WATCH: RB Derrick Locke The sophomore former track star is proving to be the most versatile of the Wildcat backs. He set a career high with eight catches for 81 yards against Alabama. WR/QB Randall Cobb Coach Rich Brooks said the true freshman might not be 100 percent, but he could see time at both receiver and quarterback against South Carolina. Cobb suffered a high ankle sprain early against Middle Tennessee State and got in for just one play against Alabama. If Cobb is healthy, he adds another dimension to what has been a bland Kentucky offense. DB Trevard Lindley The junior went toe-to-toe with Alabama freshman receiver Julio Jones and didn't back down one bit. Now, Lindley turns his focus to South Carolina's top wide out, senior Kenny McKinley. ROSTER REPORT: DT Ricky Lumpkin returned to practice after being limited last week with a high ankle injury. WR DeMoreo Ford is doubtful with a strained shoulder joint, Brooks said Monday. Ford also handles some kick returns for the Wildcats. LB Micah Johnson, who was leading the team in tackles before missing the last two weeks with ankle sprain, is "questionable at best," according to Brooks. TE T.C. Drake and S Matt Lentz are both improving, said Brooks. RG Jess Beets' bruised knee will not require surgery and is questionable against South Carolina. RG Stuart Hines suffered cartilage damage in his knee and will require surgery. He will be out indefinitely. _____________________________________________________________ SOUTH CAROLINA INSIDE SLANT A lot of things are going right for the Gamecocks as they head to Kentucky. They've won three in a row after a 1-2 start. They've settled on a quarterback in Chris Smelley, the SEC's reigning offensive player of the week. They've been buoyed by the return of all-SEC wideout Kenny McKinley. And their defense, though not No. 1 in the nation anymore, ranks No. 2 in the SEC. If they ever get their running game untracked, the Gamecocks (4-2, 1-2) would be scary. But the Gamecocks average 3.3 yards per carry and no back on the roster has more than one rushing touchdown. That puts added pressure on the passing game to produce. Smelley will face a stiff test against Kentucky. The Wildcats have speed and a strong secondary. "He had a good game," Spurrier said of Smelley's performance against Ole Miss. "He had a few careless plays that hopefully we can get rid of, but it ended up not hurting us." Smelley should have tight end Jared Cook (foot), who was injured against Ole Miss. Cook leads the team with 22 catches and has a team-high 350 receiving yards. South Carolina still has a brutal schedule remaining, including the Oct. 18 home game against LSU and trips to Florida and Clemson. NOTES, QUOTES SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: The Gamecocks have the third-best passing attack in the SEC and the third-worst rushing attack. QB Chris Smelley is coming off his best game, and the development of WR Jason Barnes and TE Jared Cook has taken some pressure off all-SEC wideout Kenny McKinley. South Carolina still looks befuddled by short-yardage situations, as evidenced by their failure on 4th-and-1 against Ole Miss. SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: The Gamecocks allow 245 yards per game, which ranks second in the SEC. S Emanuel Cook is a tackling machine and LB Eric Norwood always seems to be in the backfield. But South Carolina has struggled on third down, allowing opponents to convert 37.2 percent of the time. QUOTE TO NOTE: "We just wish sometimes we had a little more breakaway threat back there." Coach Steve Spurrier on the struggling running game. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL THIS WEEK'S GAME: South Carolina at Kentucky, Oct. 11 The Gamecocks won 38-23 last year, but these Wildcats are unlikely to yield that many points. Kentucky is coming off a frustrating near-upset of Alabama, while the Gamecocks are riding high after winning at Ole Miss. South Carolina's defense, one of the nation's best, could dominate the Wildcats' battered offensive line. PLAYERS TO WATCH: QB Chris Smelley The redshirt sophomore is the SEC offensive player of the week after throwing for a career-high 327 yards in the 31-24 win at Ole Miss. He has completed 63.1 percent of his passes this season, which ranks second among SEC quarterbacks, for 1,171 yards. His nine touchdown passes are tied for the conference lead. LB Eric Norwood The junior has 32.5 career tackles for loss and just notched his 15th sack. With his next sack, he'll pass Cecil Caldwell and move into third place on South Carolina's all-time list. RB Mike Davis The senior, who ran for 73 yards on 19 carries against Ole Miss, is under pressure to be more productive, especially in short-yardage situations. Coaches want Davis to stop using spin moves, which haven't been effective. ROSTER REPORT: TE Jared Cook sprained his right ankle on his 63-yard catch and later aggravated the injury, but he is expected to play at Kentucky. With 209 career points, K Ryan Succop has moved into second place on South Carolina's all-time scoring list. He is still way behind Collin Mackie, who scored 330 points while connecting on 72 field goals. LB Rodney Paulk is questionable for Saturday's game with a knee injury. _____________________________________________________________ TENNESSEE INSIDE SLANT The good news is that Tennessee welcomes punter Britton Colquitt back from a five-game suspension and that it has a second win under its belt as it prepares for Saturday's trip to Georgia. The bad news: Almost everything else. Offensively, the Volunteers' switch in quarterbacks from Jonathan Crompton to Nick Stephens did little to juice things up, although Stephens at least hit a couple of deep passes in the team's 13-9 victory last week against Northern Illinois. And UT must deal with a Bulldog team which is not only coming off a 41-30 loss to Alabama in which they trailed 31-0 at halftime, but has had an extra week to stew over it. Add the specter of last year's 35-14 Volunteer rout and it's clear Georgia should come with nothing less than its top effort. Question is, can this UT team, playing at its current level, do a thing about it? "We're a little behind," Vols coach Phillip Fulmer said, "but if we can continue to improve, we will see what we can do the rest of the season." Fulmer has faced job questions before during his 16-plus seasons in Knoxville, but some think a bad loss here will intensify them to the point where he might decide to leave at season's end. With the UT offense having produced just 31 points in the last three games, a sudden outburst isn't likely against the Bulldogs. If the Vols' defense can't keep the game close, this could be the kind of ugly defeat Fulmer can't afford. NOTES, QUOTES SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: Things clearly aren't working for this unit, no matter who's at quarterback. Nick Stephens completed 10-of-17 passes against Northern Illinois and hit a pair of bombs, one for the team's only score, but 13 points against a Mid-American Conference foe doesn't constitute progress. Tennessee's offensive lin e simply has to play better or else the Vols will continue to struggle to piece together wins against tough SEC opposition. SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: UT held Northern Illinois to 190 total yards and kept it out of the end zone on its three excursions inside the 20-yard line, forcing the Huskies to kick field goals that made the difference. Georgia is a stouter foe, but if the Vols can contain RB Knowshon Moreno and force QB Matt Stafford to throw at least 30 times, they should be able to hold the Bulldogs under 20 points. QUOTE TO NOTE: "We've won a couple of games in Athens. It's part of the history, but it doesn't prove anything." Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer on the Vols' last two visits to Georgia, which resulted in 19-14 and 51-33 wins in 2004 and 2006, respectively. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL THIS WEEK'S GAME: Tennessee at Georgia, Oct. 11 Unless the Volunteer offense plays at a level it hasn't come close to finding this year, the team will be a worst-case 2-4 at the midway point. If UT is to finally play up to its immense potential, it needs to make at least five plays of 20 yards or longer. That will require good decision-making from new starting QB Nick Stephens and better blocking from an offensive line which has, to be blunt, reeked this season. PLAYERS TO WATCH: QB Nick Stephens Although his first start was a winner, Stephens did get away with a major faux pas, losing a fumble deep in Vol territory. The defense bailed him out by holding Northern Illinois to a field goal. He'll have to play as close to error-free as possible while hitting some downfield passes against an aggressive Georgia defense. WR Denarius Moore The team's top receiver, Lucas Taylor, sat out last week with an injury. Moore took advantage of his opportunity to catch three passes for 65 yards, including a 52-yard touchdown in the third quarter. Moore has great speed and could earn more playing time if he continues to improve his route-running. LB Nevin McKenzie Earning the start last week at outside linebacker, McKenzie merely notched a game-high nine tackles, 2 1/2 for loss. A former safety, McKenzie changed positions in the spring and has been a playmaker in the20first half of 2008. It was his interception return for a touchdown that gave UT a halftime lead at UCLA last month. ROSTER REPORT: TB Lennon Creer didn't see the field against Northern Illinois after earning key carries late in the game at Auburn. Many were surprised since Creer is by far the team's fastest running back, but running backs coach Stan Drayton said the team didn't run enough plays (50) to use three tailbacks. MLB Ellix Wilson (shoulder) sat out against Northern Illinois, even though he was hopeful of playing. Nick Reveiz got the start and had just four tackles, a low number for a middle linebacker. The coaches hope the hard-hitting Wilson can play at Georgia. P Britton Colquitt regains his job after sitting out the first five games following his suspension for a DUI in the winter. Colquitt, who averages 42.4 yards per punt for his career, simply has a stronger leg than Chad Cunningham. Colquitt will also handle kickoff chores. _____________________________________________________________ VANDERBILT INSIDE SLANT For the first time in recent Southeastern Conference history, Vanderbilt goes from the hunter to the hunted. The East Division leaders visit Mississippi State Saturday, bringing with them a No. 13 ranking and a 5-0 record that includes three SEC wins. Incredibly, the 1-4 Bulldogs opened as a 1 1/2-point favorite. But coach Bobby Johnson could care less about odds. All that matters to him is that the Commodores forget about their attention-grabbing 14-13 win last week over Auburn. "They are a tough team that has had a tough schedule and they've had a week off, so they'll be ready to go," Johnson said. "It's going to be a tough game for us." While MSU's record isn't impressive, only one of its losses a 38-7 rout at Georgia Tech Sept. 20 was truly one-sided. It was very competitive with national champion LSU two weeks ago in a 34-24 road defeat and fell 3-2 to Auburn Sept. 13. Beyond that, there's the recent SEC trend of teams playing well coming off bye weeks. And will Vandy have some kind of emotional letdown after perhaps the biggest win of the seven-year Johnson era? Like last week's game, this game figures to be low-scoring, with anywhere from 14 to 20 points determining the winner. The key may be if the Commodores can continue to do the little things keeping turnovers and penalties to a minimum, getting short fields from defense and special teams which have carried them this season. "They've got great attitudes right now and I think they're handling everything the right way," Johnson said. NOTES, QUOTES SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: The key will be how the quarterback situation plays out. Starter Chris Nickson (shoulder) hopes to be able to play after leaving the Auburn game following the first quarter's conclusion. But if Nickson can't go, Mackenzi Adams is certainly a proven backup after compiling 207 total yards against the Tigers' excellent defense. Look for more from returning WR George Smith and TB Jeff Jennings as they work their way back into the playing rotation after early season injuries. SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: Nothing has to change here. The formula will remain the same force the opponent to rely on the pass and allow Vanderbilt to unleash one of the SEC's best pass rushes. Since Mississippi State is ground-oriented, the Commodores figure to have a good game on this side of the ball if their front seven can match the Bulldogs' physical style. QUOTE TO NOTE: "If you only have one, you're dancing in the wrong area ... with the devil. It's going to bite you later." Vanderbilt coach Bobby Johnson on the importance of having two capable quarterbacks. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL THIS WEEK'S GAME: Vanderbilt at Mississippi State, Oct. 11 Can the Commodores continue to handle success? If so, they can clinch bowl eligibility for the first time since 1982 with a win in Starkville. The Bulldogs are only 1-4, but are a tough out at home and have close losses against Auburn and LSU. Vandy would like to get its running game in gear after tailbacks Jared Hawkins and Jeff Jennings combined for 11 yards on eight carries against Auburn. Mississippi State has been gashed by the run in its last two games against Georgia Tech and LSU. PLAYERS TO WATCH: TB Jared Hawkins Coming off his first bad game of the season (six carries, eight yards) against Auburn, Hawkins should find the going easier against an MSU team which has been abused on the ground lately. That backup QB Mackenzi Adams threw for a season-high 153 yards last week might just open the tackle box a little bit for future opponents and give Hawkins more room. WR George Smith In his first game back from a foot injury which cost him the first four contests, Smith made a key catch that set up the Commodores' winning touchdown in the third quarter. A senior, Smith has the size, speed and experience to get separation from most SEC cornerbacks. His presence could give more punch to the passing game. OLB Patrick Benoist The four words which have described Benoist this season are right place, right time. A smart player who is a better athlete than many give him credit for, he was named SEC Defensive Player of the Week after making 13 tackles against Auburn. With Mississippi State's offense relying on a power running game, Benoist should have a similar game if the front four continues to play well. ROSTER REPORT: P Brett Upson was named SEC Specialist of the Week after downing four of his eight punts inside the Auburn 20 Saturday. Upson, who averaged 39.1 yards, saved his best for last with a 55-yard boomer that was downed at the 3-yard line with just over two minutes left. QB Chris Nickson (shoulder) is hopeful that he'll return to the lineup at Mississippi State. Coach Bobby Johnson wants to make sure that Nickson has full range of motion in the shoulder, though, before he'll sign off on giving him the start. It's an injury that's been an off and on thing over the last year. QB Mackenzi Adams' 153 passing yards last week doesn't sound like much, but it was a season high for the run-based Commodores. Vandy hadn't topped the 100-yard mark in any game until Auburn. _____________________________________________________________ ALABAMA INSIDE SLANT Good time for a break. Alabama's climb to the No. 2 spot in the polls has been meteoric, to say the least. And the Tide survived its worst game of the season with a 17-14 victory over Kentucky. "We have five games before we have another bye week," said Tide head coach Nick Saban. "I think there are things teams (we'll face and) will do a little different in the next five games. We'll evaluate that, and we'll evaluate personnel and if there are moves we want to make, this is a perfect time to do it, with an extra week to get those players in place whether it's offense, defense or special teams. "And we can improve on areas where we haven't been as efficient as we need to be, so that's something we can work on. Things like that. We do a quality control study on what we do well and what we've done poorly." For all of that and after weeks of warning his team and fans not to get caught up in the hype Saban actually praised his team for playing consistent football, winning six games, and playing with intensity. "The only way that people can get some emotional release is to try not to maintain it," Saban said. "But you try to create a way the players can recover a little bit so that when they come back and play in the game, it's a lot easier to get back to that intensity level." This week's plan? Chill out. "Chill out when you're supposed to chill out," Saban said. "Work when you're supposed to work." A year ago Alabama was off to a 6-2 start, then stumbled home to a 7-6 record. Part of the reason was a lack of depth that affected this team when injuries or suspensions came. This year Saban believes depth is not as critical an issue. There is still what he called a "significant" gap between the first 22 and some of the backups, but that the veterans have done a good job of working the new guys. NOTES, QUOTES TB Glen Coffee is starting to get some mention as one of the top players in the country. He rushed for 218 yards against Kentucky and is now second in the conference in rushing with 708 yards, averaging 118 yards per game, and 10th in the NCAA. However, what concerns Saban is the two fumbles against Kentucky. So during the off-week, Coffee was given a football and told to keep it with him everywhere he went. In practice, that meant holding on to a football during stretching and flex periods. "If that doesn't work, he may have to carry it in the dining hall, too," Saban said. Much of the success of this offense has to go to a veteran offensive line that has become like family living, eating, studying and working out together. They have taken karate, yoga and pilates to maximize flexibility, watch what they eat. Davis said the diet includes "good protein and a lot of good fiber," plus a protein shake between meals. The night before a game, they load up on "good greens with a grilled chicken or steak." Said Davis, "I use my common sense and try to avoid fried foods and sweets. My favorite food is ice cream and brownies." Alas, the days of ice cream and brownies are very limited. NEXT GAME: Oct. 18, Ole Miss in Tuscaloosa. Time has yet to be determined, as TV has not made the call. BYE WEEK MISSION: The team will, according to Saban, "chill out." Practice will be reduced to just three days while coaches go over "quality control" and consider what personnel changes might need to be made to get ready for the second half of the season. OCTOBER AT A GLANCE: The schedule shapes up for a November showdown at LSU. Alabama's rise coincides with significant dropoffs from Tennessee and Auburn. Only two games this month Ole Miss at home and Tennessee in Knoxville -and the Rebels look to be the bigger challenge. Alabama should be favored in every game going into the LSU game on Nov. 8. QUOTE TO NOTE: "I worry most about the team. I think sometimes the team is affected by external things what they hear, what they read, what they see, and we try to guard against that because none of those things are connected to the game, you know? How well you play on the field is not connected to the media, the poll, the fans although the fans are fantastic. I'm just saying it's unconnected. It still gets down to how you play down in and down out, how you compete. That's what I want to focus on." Alabama coach Nick Saban. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL LOOKING GOOD: The heart of this team is the offensive line, a veteran group that includes seniors Antoine Caldwell (center), Marlon Davis (guard), Mike Johnson (right tackle), and juniors Andre Smith (left tackle) and Drew Davis (guard). When the season began, coach Nick Saban told the offensive line they would be responsible for the offense as the "sergeant at arms," meaning, "if something goes wrong, if somebody is not performing and has an excuse, whatever it is, I'm coming to you." So far, the line has indeed played the role of leader and it seems to be paying huge dividends for the Tide. STILL NEEDS WORK: After playing near-flawless football for five weeks, in the sixth game the Tide had three turnovers, a season-high 10 penalties for 92 yards, and three defensive breakdowns led to big plays and two touchdowns. Alabama has to make sure these are signs of a tired team, not a sign of where this team is headed. STAR WATCH: Nose guard Terrence Cody has been the biggest surprise of the fall, and by biggest we don't just mean his 365 pounds. Cody takes up two blockers in the middle, and is still agile enough to get into offensive backfields and disrupt plays. No one really knew much about Cody before the season. Now, he's moving up the charts in the NFL draft prospectus. CRITICAL DECISION: Best decision of the offseason was to hire Jim McElwain from Fresno State to run the offense. McElwain has turned QB John Parker Wilson back into one of the top game managers in the league. Wilson owns school records in every significant passing category, but the big change is his ability not to make mistakes and get the team in the right plays. Last year he had 18 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions; this year through six games Wilson has six TD passes but only two interceptions. ROSTER REPORT: There are no injuries that Saban believes will become "an issue or a problem." That suggests that left tackle Andre Smith (elbow) and wide receiver Mike McCoy (hamstring) are minor injuries that a week's rest will take care of. Saban did say he will be giving some players extra rest this week, and that "I would appreciate it if you all didn't read into that as if there was some catastrophic event happening here. Just give me that one. We may manage practice a little different. But there's nobody hurt, nobody out." _____________________________________________________________ ARKANSAS INSIDE SLANT The Razorbacks' last three games have been so tough that Saturday's SEC tilt at Auburn actually seems like a break. Arkansas competed with Florida much more than the 38-7 final score indicated. The Razorbacks looked tougher and more emotionally charged against the Gators than they did in blowout losses to Alabama and Texas. Offensive playmakers, like freshman wide receiver Joe Adams, are developing. Junior running back Michael Smith is churning out yardage. The defense was in attack mode against Tim Tebow and the Gators and kept the Razorbacks in the game into the second half. Coach Bobby Petrino acknowledges the improvement, but he knows there's plenty of work to be done in Fayetteville. Beating Auburn could grease the skids for a run at a bowl bid in Petrino's first season, something that couldn't have been widely expected in circles of realists. Petrino's offense is making strides, but he'll need a special effort from his defense against a peculiarly disjointed Auburn offense this week. The Tigers have gone to the "unspread" offense, incorporating the I-formation and multiple tight ends, better lending to success in the running game. If the Hogs keep it close and get a big play or two, this week could be the "make" game of Arkansas' make-or-break SEC schedule. NOTES, QUOTES SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: Quarterback Casey Dick and the offense will find few scoring opportunities against a stingy Auburn defense. Dick certainly can't afford to waste them. The Razorbacks had a chance to cut Florida's lead to 14-7 right before half last week. But Dick made a bad decision, threw into triple coverage and was intercepted to end the threat. Dick is averaging one interception a game. SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: For possibly the first time all season, the Razorback defense wasn't on its heels against Florida. The Hogs were aggressive, reacted quicker and were in better position to make plays. "Cutting back the playbook really helped us execute and move fast," said Petrino. "The secondary and the linebackers were moving to the ball more quickly." QUOTE TO NOTE: "It takes time with a new coaching staff, it takes time for a new offense and defense to be put together. We came in thinking it was going to work right off the bat, but as you can see progressively things are starting to come together, and that's just looking good for us and looking good for the future." TE D.J. Williams STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL THIS WEEK'S GAME: Arkansas at Auburn, Oct. 11 The Razorbacks venture to Jordan-Hare Stadium to face the offensively challenged Tigers, who are coming off a loss to Vanderbilt. Arkansas coach Bobby Petrino was Tommy Tuberville's offense coordinator at Auburn, a stint that had a messy ending. PLAYERS TO WATCH: RB Michael Smith He's a 5-foot-7 ball of energy and has been by far the Razorbacks' most consistent offensive weapon. The junior is averaging close to 150 yards of offense per game and will need to have a big game against a stingy Auburn defense. WR Joe Adams Petrino believes Adams is headed for a bright future. Look for Adams' touches to continue to increase as the season progresses. TE D.J. Williams Another one of the Hogs' talented young receivers, the sophomore has become quarterback Casey Dick's favorite target. Williams averages five catches per game. ROSTER REPORT: RT Michael Aguirre suffered a sprained knee and ankle on the first play against Florida, according to Petrino. The offensive line could receive a shakeup. This was caused by the impressive debuts of redshirt freshmen Grant Cook and Grant Freeman. Wade Grayson, Ray Dominguez and DeMarcus Love also will be involved in the shuffle, according to the Northwest Arkansas Times. _____________________________________________________________ AUBURN INSIDE SLANT Despite rumors or perhaps hope among Auburn fans that Tommy Tuberville would junk the spread offense and maybe even fire offensive coordinator Tony Franklin, Tuberville came out this week in continued support of what Franklin is doing. Auburn (4-2, 2-2 SEC) hosts Arkansas (2-3, 0-2) this week in a Saturday game that should get one of these teams heading in the right direction. Tuberville insists that Franklin will continue to coordinate the offense, and that no one is going to panic over a struggling unit that has fallen to 104th in the nation in total offense. "The offense is behind where it needs to be," Tuberville conceded. "We've got to find some more answers. ... We've just got to look ourselves in the eye and score more points. "We're still going to run the spread offense. We went to this, but we'll tweak it every week. Last week we made a small change in some of the offense that we did. It worked early, then they made adjustments and it forced us to do other things." Clearly, however, what Auburn is running is no longer the Franklin spread, but a hybrid of sorts. Auburn did go back to a one-back, two-tight end set with the quarterback under center and ran the ball against Vanderbilt. Tuberville said Franklin is "the one changing it. A good coach is going to change for personnel." "I think Tony's done a good job of adjusting. I don't know whether we've done a good job of adjusting to what we've gone to. But he's our offensive coordinator. He's worked harder than anybody here, and he's as disappointed as anybody here. And he takes as much of the blame. He probably takes more blame than he should." In practice this week, Franklin has been "the old Tony Franklin," said wide receiver Rod Smith. "The intensity he's had at practice has been crazy. "We felt like we were in two-a-days all over again. It's a good a thing. I definitely think we need that as a team to light a fire up under us. Something needs to be done to get this offense - just getting this whole team - back in the right direction. I think the coaches are doing a great job." NOTES, QUOTES Senior WR Rod Smith joked with reporters about the 'drastic changes' in the offense. "I had a meeting with Coach Tubs," Smith said. "I'm going to be the starting quarterback now." He was kidding. We think. Coach Tommy Tuberville said defensive lineman Zach Clayton had one of the best games of his career Saturday at Vanderbilt, filling for an injured Sen'Derrick Marks and Antonio Coleman. Clayton played about 30 snaps at both end and tackle. SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: The cynic would say, what offense? Auburn ranks 104th in the NCAA in total offense, and can't seem to decide if it is running a spread passing game, a spread option game, or a more traditional one-back offense. Even the players are starting to wonder. Said TB Ben Tate, "Those guys (offensive linemen) got a hand on the ground and started coming off the ball a little bit. It was getting exciting and everybody was loving it. It felt really good. We were marching down the field. It was good overall." Then what happened? "I don't know. I really don't. I couldn't have an answer for that." SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: Despite Vanderbilt scoring twice to come from behind and beat Auburn last week, the defense continues to play to a championship level. The Tigers are still second in the SEC in scoring defense (11.2 points per game), third in total defense (248.8 yards per game), leads in third-down conversion defense (allowing just 18.1 percent) and ranks third in quarterback sacks. That will keep any team in any game. QUOTE TO NOTE: "We're still searching." Auburn head coach Tommy Tuberville, on his teams' offensive identity. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL THIS WEEKS GAME: Arkansas at Auburn, Oct. 11 The headline is clearly Tuberville vs. Petrino. In 2003, Bobby Petrino is the coach (then at Louisville) who Auburn trustees went after and offered Tuberville's job without Tuberville knowing it. The plan backfired when word leaked and Auburn bounced back to beat Alabama. Still, Petrino is a reminder to Tuberville of how his school turned on him behind his back, and despite the success Tuberville has had since that '03 season, he has not forgotten. PLAYERS TO WATCH: QB Chris Todd/Kodi Burns It's always the same story. Both played against Vanderbilt, and both looked equally ineffective. But this is apparently the best Auburn has, so somehow the Tigers have to figure out how to make it work. RB Ben Tate Leads Auburn in rushing with 501 yards. He's one offensive player that, when given the opportunity, performs. K Wes Byrum He has struggled, missing his last three field goals and a critical extra point in what turned out to be a one-point loss. He insists he has not lost his confidence and keeps winning the job in practice. We'll see. ROSTER REPORT DL Sen'Derrick marks injured an ankle in the Vanderbilt game. X-rays were negative, so he's expected to play. DB Jerraud Powers pulled a hamstring and is listed as "day to day." TB Brad Lester re-injured his knee and is day-to-day. KR Robert Dunn injured an ankle before the Vandy game and didn't make the trip. He is expected to return to practice and be able to play against Arkansas. DE Antonio Coleman has a pulled muscle and is day-to-day. _____________________________________________________________ LSU INSIDE SLANT LSU may have been excused for letting its attention wander in the early part of its schedule. With the exception of a trip to Auburn, the Tigers (4-0, 2-0 SEC) were expected to breeze along, and they have. That isn't the case now. The Tigers are headed to Florida and one of the toughest stadiums to play in the league. And they face a dangerous Gators team that knows it may be playing for its conference life. That suits coach Les Miles. "Make no bones about it," he said as the Tigers began their game-week preparations. "This is a fun game to play. You play in the SEC, you play classic matchups, and you better enjoy this one. I can promise you that there will be a lot more energy around our building this week. We'll look forward to playing well at Florida." Though they are in different divisions, the game will impact the chances of both on getting to the SEC title game. LSU has a little more wiggle room after beating Auburn and Mississippi State in its first two conference games. If the Tigers would lose to the Gators but win out, they would win the division by virtue of a victory over Alabama. But if the Gators lose, it would be their second SEC loss and would leave them needing help to get back to the title game. They lost to Ole Miss in the last home game but bounced back to rout Arkansas on the road. "They don't have any weaknesses," Miles said of the Gators. "They're nationally ranked at No. 11, which is probably underselling them some. I think they're as talented a football team as I've seen." The Tigers schedule originally had an open date on Nov. 15 but now will feature a home game against Troy. LSU was to host Troy on Sept. 6 but the game was postponed because of the aftereffects of Hurricane Gustav. That means LSU will have game day Saturdays for eight straight weeks. "Those open weeks are fun and good to give for our team's legs," Miles said. "But the truth is, Saturday we grind our teeth a little bit and watch someone else play, and it is not near as much fun. Looking at the next run, I can hardly wait." NOTES, QUOTES SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: LSU has opened up its passing game behind redshirt freshman QB Jarrett Lee and that, combined with RB Charles Scott's running, is producing a league-best 427 yards a game. WRs Brandon LaFell and Demetrius Byrd both have the ability to break big plays, and TE Richard Dickson is a reliable target, too. In last year's win over Florida, LSU converted five straight fourth downs to first downs. They'll need to execute with similar aplomb in pressure situations this week. SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: The Tigers' D-line specifically DT Ricky Jean-Francois added some spice to the already tantilizing matchup between LSU and Tim Tebow's Florida offense, telling the Orlando Sentinel the the LSU defensive line getting a clean shot on a quarterback like Tim Tebow equates to "a car wreck without a seat belt." "I think every lineman wants to get a good hit on a Heisman Trophy winner," Jean-Francois said. LSU's defense is giving up only about 261 yards a game total and is holding foes to only 69 yards a game on the ground. The strength is up front with tackles like Charles Alexander, Ricky Jean-Francois and Marlon Favorite. Along with ends Tyson Jackson and Kirston Pittman, they should give Florida QB Tim Tebow a challenge. Tebow passed for 205 yards and ran for 67 yards against LSU last season. The Tigers won 28-24. QUOTE TO NOTE: "I think he's continuing to come. He's had practices like he had games, and he's had some really strong practices in the last week. We expect that to continue. As we get into game plans, his ability to master the game plan is, in my opinion, a weekly event, and it's one in which he's doing a really good job, in my opinion, to start this game week." Coach Les Miles, on the progress of redshirt freshman Jarrett Lee. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL THIS WEEK'S GAME: LSU at Florida, Oct. 11 The clash in Gainesville pits the two highest-scoring teams in the conference. Florida's average is 36 points a game, LSU 35.5. The Gators also have a slight edge on defense, giving up 11.4 points to LSU's 15.2. But the Tigers are more productive in total offense (427.2 to 390.2) and stingier on defense (260.8 to 265). Any way you look at it, it should be a classic. PLAYERS TO WATCH: RB Charles Scott Scott's is the SEC's leading rusher by far (133.8 yards a game) and is seventh in the nation. He has six rushing touchdowns, second to Georgia's Knowshon Moreno in that category. He can get the tough yards inside but also has the speed to break off a big play. He has topped the 100-yard mark rushing in each of LSU's four games. WR Brandon LaFell LaFell is averaging 87 yards a game receiving, which leads the SEC, and is third in catches per game with five. He's also an excellent downfield blocker. QB Jarrett Lee Since going 0-of-5 passing in the first half at Auburn with an interception returned for a touchdown, Lee has gone 29-of-44 over the last six quarters for 443 yards and four touchdowns. ROSTER REPORT: LB Darry Beckwith (knee) is expected back for the trip to Florida. He hasn't played being injured against North Texas. He has missed the last two games against Auburn and Mississippi State. DTs Ricky Jean-Francois (leg), Charles Alexander (ankle), and LB Kelvin Sheppard (undisclosed) are expected back after missing some practice time. QB Andrew Hatch, who started the first three games but has played since sustaining a concussion in the first half at Auburn, will play against Florida. Coach Les Miles said Jarrett Lee will start but Hatch could come into the game as soon as the second or third series or perhaps even later. "Who knows?" Miles said. _____________________________________________________________ MISSISSIPPI INSIDE SLANT Ole Miss (3-3, 1-2) has alternated wins and losses all season. While the Rebels have shown tremendous potential, especially in a win at Florida, they've also shown a capacity for self-destruction. With Ole Miss off until an Oct. 18 trip to Alabama, coach Houston Nutt wants to work on his team's psyche. "That's where the biggest job comes in, changing the mindset," he said. "When something bad happens, that's what you are trying to change for four straight years. And it's hard. It's harder than I thought." It will be a long two weeks for speedster Dexter McCluster, who had a game-changing fumble inside the South Carolina 10. The Rebels lost the lead shortly thereafter and never recovered in a 31-24 defeat. "You love his competitiveness and he always grades out high," Nutt said. "You have to tell him, as fearless as he is, when he is in that crowd, especially when he's in a crowd and already has the first down, to go down on that ball with both hands on it. "With a small guy like that in this league, he is fighting for every inch he gets, and he leaves the ball in a vulnerable position and we can't have that." NOTES, QUOTES SCOUTING THE OFFENSE: The Rebels are generating 382 total yards per game, fourth-best in the SEC, but have hurt themselves with 15 turnovers (10 INTs). They're still scoring 29.2 points per game. QB Jevan Snead is throwing for 212 yards per game. WR Dexter McCluster is explosive (626 receiving and rushing yards) but must hold onto the football. SCOUTING THE DEFENSE: Among SEC teams, only Arkansas gives up more points than the Rebels (24.7 points per game). The Rebels are decent against the run, but hapless against the pass, allowing a league-worst 229 passing yards per game. S Jamarca Sanford ranks third in the SEC with 56 tackles. QUOTE TO NOTE: "Offensively it's definitely going to be ball handling and taking care of the ball." coach Houston Nutt on what the Rebels will work on during their off week. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL PLAYERS TO WATCH: QB Jevan Snead The sophomore transfer from Texas is completing just 55.2 percent of his throws, with nine TDs and nine INTs. But he's averaging 212 passing yards per game, which ranks third in the SEC. WR Mike Wallace A solid receiver, Wallace excels as a kickoff returner. He's averaging 27.7 yards per return, second-best in the SEC. S Jamarca Sanford After five games, Sanford ranked third in the SEC with 56 tackles, averaging 9.3 per game. ROSTER REPORT: WR Lionel Breaux hurt his shoulder in the loss to South Carolina but should be fine for the Oct. 18 game at Alabama. S Johnny Brown suffered a slight concussion against South Carolina, but also should play against Alabama. Junior CB Cassius Vaughn isn't in the doghouse, but coaches aren't pleased with his production. "I want to get more out of Cassius Vaughn. He is better than what he is showing," coach Houston Nutt said. _____________________________________________________________ more | | | • • • • • • • About USATODAY.com: | | | | | | | | News Your Way: | | | | | Partners: | | | Copyright 2008 USA TODAY, a division of
