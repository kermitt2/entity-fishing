The Lubbock, Texas, auto dealer says quick action will thaw frozen credit, restore consumer confidence and help the auto industry. "This credit crunch is real on Main Street," she said. "If the country can break the credit freeze on Wall Street, then we can help provide the economy on Main Street." About 94 percent of vehicle buyers in the country finance their purchases, but even those with credit scores in the 700s, previously considered good credit, cannot get financing, Sykora said. Dealers with good credit also are having trouble getting financing for their inventories, Sykora said. There currently are more than 20,000 auto dealers in the country, and even in good times, some go out of business. About 430 dealerships closed last year and 295 closed in 2006, according to the NADA. The estimate of 700 dealers going out of business does not include new dealers that will enter the market. Associated Press Eli Lilly settles over Zyprexa marketing Drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co. announced a $62 million settlement Tuesday over its top-selling drug Zyprexa, an antipsychotic medication. Lilly agreed to pay 32 states and Washington, D.C., to resolve an investigation into the company's marketing practices. California is among the states involved. Attorneys general from several states had accused Lilly of marketing Zyprexa for off-label uses and inadequately disclosing its side effects to health care providers. Lilly was accused of marketing the drug for pediatric care, for use at a high dose and for the treatment of dementia. Doctors are free to prescribe drugs for uses not approved by the FDA, but drug companies cannot market them for those situations. The company did not admit wrongdoing.
