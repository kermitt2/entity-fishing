On Sept. 15, the Dallas Chapter of the Military Order of the World Wars (MOWW) and the office of U.S. Rep. Kenny Marchant presented the Coppell YMCA with a silver Patrick Henry medallion and certificate for their donation drive at their committee meeting. LTC King Moss II, the Dallas Chapter Commander, presented the award to John Moore, board chairman of the Coppell YMCA. Capt. John Hayes, former Dallas Chapter Commander, presented a Certificate of Commendation and a U.S. flag which had flown over the U.S. Capital to the YMCA on behalf of U.S. Rep. Kenny Marchant. “The Coppell YMCA’s support of the men and women of the US military represents the finest qualities of citizenship and patriotic service in our society,” said LTC Don Munson, of Coppell. The donation drive, started by Melissa Ewasko, YMCA fitness coordinator and community service committee member, collects any type of entertainment which includes books, CDs, games, DVDS, etc. for troops. She said she started the collection idea when she saw an article where Munson was collecting items for troops with his organization, At Ease, which is partnered with the United Service Organizations (USO). Every six weeks, YMCA members pack up between six to seven boxes of donated materials and bring them to the USO at the D/FW International Airport where soldiers can enjoy them on their 16-hour flight to and from the Middle East. Although the donation box was set up July 2 and sits next to the information desk at the YMCA building, it already has had hundreds of items donated. MOWW is a national patriotic association of military officers that helps soldiers know their duty and courage is appreciated. The Patrick Henry award for patriotic achievement is the highest honor that a chapter can bestow on a civic organization. “I can’t think of anything that could be more charitable than to do something for the USO,” said Deane Fox, YMCA member. Fox, who formerly served in the navy, knows the risk that soldiers make when they step out of their house to serve their country. “In my opinion, there is nobody else that we could help as well as we might be able to help than the USO, Fox said. “We got people risking their lives to make our lives what we have today.” Munson and Capt. Derrick Wilson, both chapter members and citizens of Coppell, were also present. Ewasko said she would still like the other YMCAs to get involved in the donation project and will work on ways in the future for different YMCA committees to come together and make this a YMCA initiative.
