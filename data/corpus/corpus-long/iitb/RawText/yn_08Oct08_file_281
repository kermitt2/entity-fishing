It's biding its time, patiently awaiting takeoff. For all intents and purposes, Meese already has taken off. Brothers Patrick and Nathan Meese & Co. are wrapping their Atlantic Records debut CD, with a planned February release that is expected to launch our amiable pop-rockers on a similar if not quite as stratospheric journey as their local brethren, The Fray. Friday's capacity show at the Oriental Theater was both a chance for everyone to get reacquainted while introducing to fans much of the new or newly repackaged material that will make up its '09 release. A highlight was when The Fray frontman Isaac Slade joined Patrick Meese for a melancholy, gorgeous duet called "Movie Screens." John Moore Nick Cave . Demon seed was spilled on the Ogden Theatre stage Sept. 26 as Nick Cave and his Bad Seeds delivered a testosterone-fueled throwback set that proved the vigorous Aussie, four days removed from his own 51st birthday party, is one sweaty, sexy beast. This one will go down as one of "those shows," the full-throttled kind that feels at first memorable, eventually historic. John Moore Sigur Ros. Colorado fans rarely need cajoling to get rowdy. This, after all, is the land of burning couches, where tear gas is a key ingredient in sports celebrations and where some swear the hideous crowd "wave" was born. But those are all sports-related phenomenons and none occurred at the Sept. 27 Sigur Ros concert, where fans mostly sat and listened intently to the important music flowing from the stage. Sigur Ros, an Icelandic band with roots in the shoegazing genre, make cinematic music sung in a made-up language. Yet the group, a critical darling, had to resort to the unthinkable toward the end of Saturday's concert at Red Rocks: politely asking fans to stand up and appear to enjoy the show. Jeremy Meyer Dandy Warhols . If Courtney Taylor-Taylor isn't a pretentious jerk, he sure is good at acting like one. The pouty-lipped Taylor-Taylor, lead singer and guitarist of psychedelic pop-rockers the Dandy Warhols, made his entrance to the stage of the Gothic Theatre on Sept. 30 already posturing, cocking his head back and constantly pushing his long, artfully greased mane to the side in dramatic sweeps. "What is this, a frat party?" Taylor demanded, ridiculing lovelorn boys in the front row for professing their love to tambourine/keyboardist Zia McCabe.
