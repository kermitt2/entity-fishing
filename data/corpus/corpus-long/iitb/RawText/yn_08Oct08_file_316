Vujanovic said Montenegro needed to make a decision on Kosovo's status soon. President Filip Vujanovic said Tuesday the decision will have to be made soon because of Montenegro's desire to become an European Union and NATO member. Serbia's Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic on Monday warned Montenegro against recognizing Kosovo, which split from Serbia in February. He said it would represent "a stab in the back." The Montenegrin recognition of Kosovo would be a major blow to Serbia, because the two Balkan states -- which have close historical and cultural ties -- comprised a single state until 2006.
