The Department of Health will start a four-day work week pilot beginning Oct. 13 and ending Friday, Dec. 5. The reduced work week will apply to the approximately 269 employees at the department’s offices at the Kinau Hale Building at 1250 Punchbowl St.. The department provides direct service to the public and issues certified copies of vital records. The birth, death and marriage certificate certified copies window hours will be expanded from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and closed on Fridays. Marriage license hours will be expanded from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and closed on Fridays. Certified copies of birth and marriage certificates are available on a limited basis online at . All other offices within Kinau Hale will operate from 7:15 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and will be closed on Fridays during the pilot project. In August, the Hawaii Department of Human Resources Development was the first department to initiate the pilot project. Gov. Linda Lingle’s administration launched the program as part of continuing efforts to reduce expenses, streamline state government operations and alleviate traffic congestion by keeping workers off the road during peak travel hours. State officials said they will monitor the impact to the department’s services and determine whether there are cost savings associated with reduced energy use during the three months. The Department of Health was asked to join the pilot project so that more data could be measured in order to assess the project.
