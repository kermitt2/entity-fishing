The load factor, or proportion of seats filled, declined 1.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 80.9 percent, Paris-based Air France-KLM said today in a statement. The number of passengers fell 1.5 percent to 6.52 million. Growth in traffic, or the number of passengers multiplied by the distance flown, is slowing worldwide amid a deepening financial turmoil and signs of recession in the U.S. and Europe. AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc., the U.S.'s three biggest carriers, as well as British Airways Plc have reported drops in September traffic. British Airways, Europe's third-biggest airline, said Oct. 3 that sales of premium and economy tickets fell in September, with first- and business-class traffic dropping 8.6 percent as the credit crisis led to job losses and tighter budgets in the City of London and Wall Street. The carrier's stock fell to a 5 1/2-year low in London trading yesterday, while Air France dropped 6.2 percent to 14.4 euros in Paris trading. Air France hasn't yet reported a traffic drop in 2008 and, unlike SkyTeam alliance partner Delta or British Airways, it's adding seats, although fewer than planned. Capacity Increases The French carrier has restricted capacity increases in the October-to-April winter schedule and next summer to 2 percent. Atlanta-based Delta says it will reduce seating by 13 percent and British Airways will trim capacity by as much as 5 percent. Traffic on Air France's routes to North and South America rose 3.2 percent last month, while the airline boosted capacity to the region by 2 percent. The load factor gained 1 percentage point to 85.9 percent. Asian traffic increased 1.4 percent, while the carrier added 5.3 percent to capacity, causing the load factor to drop 3.3 points to 86.4 percent. Traffic in Europe, Air France's biggest market, fell 2 percent while the carrier increased seating by 1.2 percent, bringing the load factor down 2.4 points to 72.5 percent. African and Middle Eastern traffic fell 1.6 percent, with capacity rising 1 percent. That led to a decline in load factor of 2.1 percentage points to 78.7 percent.
