Police ask for help finding thieves. By Alexandra Zavis, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer October 8, 2008 A summer surge in the price of copper has produced a rash of wire thefts from city light poles, Los Angeles officials said today. There have been at least eight such thefts in the Hollenbeck area since August, affecting lighting and safety in the community, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement. "Copper wire theft has become an alarming epidemic," said Capt. Blake Chow, the Hollenbeck Division commanding officer. "Since the increase in copper prices, thieves have been stealing copper wire from wherever they can." City lights are often destroyed in the process, said H. David Nahai, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. "Copper wire thieves who target LADWP infrastructure steal directly from our rate payers," he said in the statement. By interfering with power distribution and transmission systems, they also risk their own lives, he said. Copper prices peaked at $4.06 a pound in July but have dropped with the sinking economy, closing today at $2.53. Representatives of the DWP and the bureau of street lighting joined Chow, LAPD detectives and City Councilman Jose Huizar at a news conference today to appeal for public help in tracking down those responsible for the thefts. "By stealing copper wiring from light posts, these thieves are perpetuating crimes against entire communities," Huizar said in the statement. "It's going to take a community response to stop them. We must all keep an eye out for suspicious activity." A number of possible suspects have been detained, but police need additional witnesses to come forward to help prosecute the crimes. The most recent incident took place Sept. 22 at Boyle Avenue and Short Street, police said. Witnesses described seeing two men, about 25 to 30 years old, driving a maroon van.
