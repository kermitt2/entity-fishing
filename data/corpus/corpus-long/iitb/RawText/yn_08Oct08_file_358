A press release form StatoilHydro says that the reports describe actions which could break Norwegian and American anti-corruption regulations. Tore Torvund was head of Hydro's oil division and Morten Ruud was head of international exploration and production in Hydro. When Hydro and Statoil merged on October 1. last year, the companies made public that they would examine payments made to consultants in Libya between 1992 and 2002. "We have to admit that we made mistakes in the way we handled Hydro’s former Libyan portefolio," says Hydro boss Eivind Reiten. Reiten confirms that he had no knowledge of the payments, according to news bureau NTB.
