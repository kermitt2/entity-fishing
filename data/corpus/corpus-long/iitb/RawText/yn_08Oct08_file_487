Linebacker Bradie James echoed the sentiments of quarterback Tony Romo and said he refused to be ashamed over the victory, however ugly. "We played well enough to win the game," James said. "I know everybody is going to say whatever, but I never apologize for a win. There are no bad wins." James said the Cowboys have been critical of themselves. But he said they refuse to be critical in public because the media will blow it out of proportion. James said the Cowboys' positive outlook comes from head coach Wade Phillips, who said Monday that complaining isn't coaching. "I think it's important that you feel good about yourself no matter what," Phillips said. "I think you can go overboard certainly, and I think I know where the line is, especially with the team. With the press and the media, I defend the team more than I do with them. When I talk to them some things are a little bit different because I want to tell them exactly what I think. "I want to defend them when people are attacking them or if I feel like they're attacking them so I remain positive. I tell the guys how it is and what we need to do better and we didn't do this or that good enough." NOTES, QUOTES —WR Terrell Owens has finally explained the tears that flowed Sunday following a 57-yard touchdown catch against the Bengals. It was not out of frustration because he had only one other reception before the fourth-quarter touchdown. It was not because of the media controversy of the past week over his complaints about not being used in the offense enough. It was simply due to the death of a family member and his emotions after talking to his pastor the night before. "I was playing with a heavy heart," Owens said. "Everything that happened on Sunday, I had talked (about with) my pastor Anthony Gardner out of Philadelphia the night before the game. When I got emotional, it was an anointed emotion, is what he explained to me. When it happened, I knew it was going to happen. He told me the night before it was going to happen, so when I went to the sideline, the emotions hit me." —One week after getting 18 passes thrown in his direction against the Redskins, wide receiver Terrell Owens had just three passes come his way against the Bengals. Yes, one was a game-winning 57-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. But it was the culmination of a trying week and the indication that the controversy surrounding Owens' involvement in the Cowboys' offense is not going to go away. Owens cried on the sideline after the touchdown. After the game, he read a one-minute speech to the media and left without taking questions. —The Cowboys had one interception after four games. Only the winless Lions shared that dubious stat. So count the Cowboys relieved they got an interception on the first play from scrimmage against the Bengals. But no one would have guessed that linebacker Greg Ellis would be the one making that pick. "When it happened, we all looked at each other on the sideline," defensive coordinator Brian Stewart said. "I'm sure if anybody had a pool going, nobody had Greg Ellis getting that first one." "If you took that to Vegas, you'd really be rich right now," said Ellis, who now has three interceptions in his 10-year career. STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL PLAYER NOTES —CB Terence Newman missed the Bengals game because he remains bothered by a torn groin he suffered in training camp. The Cowboys might sit him against the Cardinals on Sunday. —SS Roy Williams will be out at least another week with a broken arm. He might return to practice this week, but he will not play against the Cardinals. —RB Felix Jones has scored a touchdown in four of the Cowboys' five games. The only game he didn't score in was the only one in which the Cowboys didn't give him the ball. That was in a loss to the Redskins. —TE Jason Witten led the Cowboys in receptions for the fifth straight time. He had eight catches for 79 yards. REPORT CARD VS. BENGALS PASSING OFFENSE: C - QB Tony Romo threw three touchdown passes, but the passing game was hit or miss much of the day. Romo threw for just 176 yards. He threw an interception, extending his streak to eight games. Terrell Owens only saw three passes come his way. RUSHING OFFENSE: A — One week after rushing just 11 times, the Cowboys ran 38 times for 198 yards, including a 33-yard touchdown run by rookie Felix Jones, against the Bengals. PASS DEFENSE: C - Bengals QB Carson Palmer was pretty awful. He missed wide open receivers, but because of a lack of pressure by the Cowboys defense, the Bengals were able to hang around and get back in the game. RUSH DEFENSE: A — The Bengals rushed for just 61 yards on 23 carries. Tank Johnson forced a crucial fumble from running back Chris Perry to end a Bengals rally. SPECIAL TEAMS: D — The Cowboys were gashed for kickoff returns of 46 and 60 yards. Their coverage units were unsuccessful on Sunday. COACHING: B — The Cowboys looked unmotivated and disinterested but found a way to turn back the winless Bengals. Posted | | | To report corrections and clarifications, contact Reader Editor .
