"There will be a meeting, I hope in Paris, of neighboring countries," Kouchner told members of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee. Paris has asked Pakistan, Iran and other neighboring countries to attend because they could play a role in helping Afghanistan reach peace with the Taliban militia, he said. Kouchner didn't give a date for the meeting. The foreign minister reiterated that France supports Afghan President Hamid Karzai's bid to hold talks with moderates within the Taliban movement, which was ousted from Kabul in 2001 during a U.S.-led invasion.
