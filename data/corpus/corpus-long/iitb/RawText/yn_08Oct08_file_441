NEWMAN gnewman@tampatrib.com Published: October 8, 2008 PLANT CITY - The funeral service for a 17-year-old girl who was shot at a party Saturday has been moved to Plant City Church of God, 2103 Mud Lake Road. Brooke S. McDonald's parents, Barbara and Mitch McDonald, moved the service from the Wells Memorial Funeral Home chapel to accommodate more mourners. The family will receive friends from 2 to 3 p.m. Thursday at the church. There will be a memorial service afterward, also at the church. There will be a graveside service at Mount Enon Cemetery, off North Frontage Road and east of Charlie Taylor Road. McDonald was killed when Thomas Grieco, 20, pointed a .44-caliber Magnum at her head and pulled the trigger, apparently not knowing the handgun was loaded, Plant City police said. Grieco, who was charged with manslaughter, was released from Hillsborough County Jail on Monday after posting $100,000 bail. Loading Comments...
