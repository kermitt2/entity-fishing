He said the two countries were acutely aware of the time constraint to work out a deal on the presence of foreign troops on Iraqi soil before the end of the year, but declined to be pinned down to a deadline. "Discussions between the two have achieved a very advanced level and the disputed points will be resolved," Zebari told reporters in Baghdad. "We are very close to reaching a satisfactory result for the two countries and the two people." Baghdad and Washington are in talks over the accord, dubbed the Status of Forces Agreement , to decide the future status of US troops after a UN Security Council mandate for the multinational force expires on December 31. But differences remain, notably on granting immunity to US soldiers for acts committed in Iraq, whether Washington has the right to detain Iraqi prisoners, and on the future command of military operations on the ground. Zebari, speaking at a press conference with visiting US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte , said the two sides had cleared many of the sticking points on immunity and jurisdiction.
