Partly because of that reason he is teaming up with the local theater on a fund-raiser. The theater is housed in the former Ludlow High School, where Mazzaferro was once a student. "This is my old school auditorium," he explained as he gestured to the theater around him. "I was actually expelled for kissing a girl in this very auditorium," he said, "an innocent kiss goodbye on the cheek, but the principal saw it." Mazzaferro harbors no ill will over the incident and, in fact, has nothing but fond memories of the Ludlow where he grew up and began performing when he was 14 at the nearby building that was once the Ludlow Boys and Girls Club. Now, as a veteran singer and entertainer, Mazzaferro is returning to stage two fund-raising performances on Oct. 16 to help provide the Exit 7 Players and their theater with operating funds. Mazzaferro will be launching a new act - "One on One With Jimmy Mazz: An Intimate Evening of Romance & Love Songs." "My performances are usually very high-energy, talkative, informative and humorous," he said, "but this new show is mellower with many of my personal favorite love songs of the old-time crooners, such as Engelbert Humperdinck and Perry Como. There are some that are upbeat, but you won't find 'Sweet Caroline' and the audience clapping along." "Jimmy and I have known each other for many years," said Exit 7 Players President and Technical Director Paul Hamel. "He's come to the theater, and I've gone to see him perform on a regular basis." When Mazzaferro approached him about a fund-raiser, Hamel said, he jumped at the opportunity to bring in a larger and more diverse group of theater-goers. Still an interactive audience experience, Mazzaferro's new show will see the entertainer moving throughout the theater to perform and talk with the spectators. The show additionally includes an accompanist on a baby grand piano and a female backup singer. "This theater group has worked very hard for many years to make a place for itself in the community, and it puts on great productions at a great value, often on a shoestring budget," Mazzaferro said. "They do it because they love it." The next production for the Exit 7 Players, founded in 1984, will be "Scrooge the Musical" in December. Also scheduled is Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" in February and a yet-to-be announced musical to mark the group's 25th anniversary in May.
