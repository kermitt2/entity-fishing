Sharpe strained his groin on Thursday when he stumbled during practice and was forced to withdraw from the match. "It’s unfortunate but the injury is restricting Nathan, so the choice was made for us," Australia coach Robbie Deans said. "We gave it as much time as we could, to allow it to settle but with the game just two days away, we had to make the call and move on." Deans said reserve lock Dean Mumm would replace Sharpe in the starting lineup alongside James Horwill, while Queensland flanker Hugh McMeniman had been added to the bench. "The loss of Nathan obviously tests our depth, in terms of the test experience our two locks have but we’ve got total confidence in the guys who are there," Deans added. "They’ve done the work on the training paddock and competed well in their test careers so far. There’s a great opportunity ahead for both of them." TEAMS: 15-Adam Ashley-Cooper, 14-Peter Hynes, 13-Stirling Mortlock (captain), 12-Berrick Barnes, 11-Lachlan Turner, 10-Matt Giteau, 9-Luke Burgess, 8-Stephen Hoiles, 7-Phil Waugh, 6-Rocky Elsom, 5-Dean Mumm, 4-James Horwill, 3-Al Baxter, 2-Stephen Moore, 1-Benn Robinson ..... continued below Advertisement starts Advertisement ends Replacements: 16-Adam Freier, 17-Ben Alexander, 18-Hugh McMeniman, 19-George Smith, 20-Sam Cordingley, 21-Ryan Cross, 22-Cameron Shepherd.
