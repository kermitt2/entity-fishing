Harvin sprained his right ankle Saturday at Arkansas and was placed in a protective boot. "We hope to get him back [Wednesday]," Meyer said. Harvin leads 11th ranked Gators with 19 catches for 284 yards and three touchdowns. The junior also has 27 carries for 177 yards and two scores. Running back (hamstring) was limited Tuesday, and fellow tailback (ankle) missed practice. Moore could play against the Tigers, but Meyer said Moody is doubtful. Both players missed last week's game against the Razorbacks.
