    Updated: New York , Oct 08 07:31 London , Oct 08 12:31 Tokyo , Oct 08 20:31 RESOURCES Liberals, Trailing in Canada Polls, Link Harper to Bush in Ad By Alexandre Deslongchamps Oct. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Liberal Party attacked Conservative Party Prime Minister for being the ``same'' as in a new ad, part of an effort to step up criticism of the government's management of the economy and foreign policy in a bid to blunt its lead in the polls. The advertisement, posted on the front page of the Toronto- based Globe and Mail newspaper's Web site, features a smiling Harper standing behind Bush with the backdrop of a U.S. flag and the phrases ``Same on the Economy'' and ``Same on Foreign Policy.'' The ad claims Harper would have sent Canadian troops to Iraq had he been in power in 2003 and blames him for letting businesses police themselves. Dion, 53, who has trailed Harper in polls since elections were called last month, is gaining support in the final week before the Oct. 14 vote. A Nanos Research poll for CPAC yesterday showed the Conservative Party's lead has narrowed to 4 percentage points, from 14 points Sept. 27. The poll of 1,200 voters conducted Oct. 1-4 had the Conservatives at 34 percent, against 30 percent for the Liberals. Harper argued in 2003 that the Liberal government at the time should do more to support the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Harper has also criticized greenhouse gas targets set by the Kyoto treaty. An Ipsos Reid poll taken Aug. 26-28 showed 50 percent of Canadians see Harper as the best person to lead the country, compared with 20 percent for Dion. The survey of 1,005 adults had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. To be sure, after two-and-a-half years in power, 41 percent of voters still think the prime minister has a ``hidden agenda'' of right-wing policies he'd impose once he had a majority of votes in the legislature, according to the same poll.
