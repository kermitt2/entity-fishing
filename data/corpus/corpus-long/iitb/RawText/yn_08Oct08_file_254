UQ guest speaker brings music to the ears Published: 07 October 2008 Professor Graeme Clark, the pioneer of the multiple-channel cochlear implant (bionic ear), will speak at the UQ Medical Society's ES Meyers Memorial Lecture on Friday, October 10. The outstanding work of Professor Clark, who was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 2004, has been implanted in more than 100,000 people worldwide. Professor Clark is also the founder and research director of the Bionic Ear Institute and has received multiple honorary doctorates from universities around the world. The free lecture is named after Dr Errol Solomon Meyers, one of the founding fathers of The University of Queensland Medical Society and an advocate in professional health education in Queensland. Dr Solomon was also a leader in postgraduate medical education. Each year, UQ's Medical Society invites a keynote speaker from the fields of medicine, science, sports, art, literature or diplomacy to talk. Past guest speakers have included biologist Lord Robert Winston, Nobel Laureate Dr Peter Doherty, author Lord Jeffrey Archer and mountaineer and diplomat Sir Edmund Hillary. This is the 51st year the lecture will be held, with participation numbers in previous years in excess of 2000 people. A donation will be made on the night to the Ashintosh Trust, the charity established by UQ'S Medical Society. The lecture will be held at The University of Queensland's St Lucia campus, UQ Centre Exhibition Hall, 6.30pm for a 7pm start.
