(AKI) - The United States has reiterated its support for an independent Kosovo and its opposition to any move to partition the country. US Defence Secretary Robert Gates made the remarks about Washington's position during a visit to Kosovo on Tuesday. Serbian President Boris Tadic said in a recent interview he might consent to a partitioning of Kosovo's Serbian enclaves if all other efforts failed. However, Gates said the US opposed partition. “Kosovo is an independent state...and the partitioning can’t be a solution. Therefore the US supports territorial integrity of Kosovo,” he concluded. Gates, the highest US official to visit Kosovo since it declared independence, met Kosovar President Fatmir Seidiu and Prime Minister Hasim Taci in Pristina. He also visited American soldiers at the US military base of Bondsteel near Pristina. He made a brief stop in Kosovo between visits to Hungary and neighbouring Macedonia. Gates said the 16,000 strong international force (KFOR) enjoyed great respect in Kosovo and would remain there as long at least until the end of next year. KFOR was deployed in Kosovo in 1999, after Serbian forces withdrew from the province following NATO bombing and the province was put under United Nations' control. Serbia, which rejects Kosovo's independence, is fighting a diplomatic battle to retain the former province under its control. Close to 50 countries have recognised Kosovo in the past eight months, but Serbia’s ally Russia has threatened to block a resolution recognising Kosovo in the United Nations' Security Council. Seidiu and Taci thanked Gates for American support to Kosovo's independence bid and said they expected more countries to recognise it in the coming months. Serbia has submitted a resolution to the UN General Assembly demanding the International Court of Justice to consider the legality of Kosovo independence. The resolution will be considered by the General Assembly on Wednesday.   Bookmark whit: 11:52 11:12 10:51 10:21 09:36 19:14 18:57 18:51 12:35 12:34 12:31 12:11 12:00 11:48 11:30 11:10 12:24 12:12 12:07 11:55 11:31 10:55 10:47 20:36 Features AKI English highlights info Contact us ý GMC Group ý all rights reserved ý TVA number 01145141006 AKI - Adnkronos International, registered at the Rome Court 7th April 2003, registration number 156.
