A contractor from a home next door to the vacant house said he saw his day laborer, James Eldridge, 31, of 241 Main St. in Torrington, inside the home trying to bust the pipes, police said. The pipes sprayed water throughout the house, and the contractor called the real estate company trying to sell the house.
