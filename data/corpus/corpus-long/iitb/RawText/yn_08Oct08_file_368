Valencia Globe Staff / October 8, 2008 | | | | Text size – + A Medford man was sentenced to life in prison yesterday for raping two hearing-impaired children, a sentence prosecutors said was fitting for the horrendous nature of his crimes. Philip Duffy, 48, was also sentenced in Middlesex Superior Court to an additional 10 to 12 years after his life sentence. He was found guilty in August, after a 10-day trial, of eight counts of rape of a child, three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14, five counts of indecent assault and battery on a person over 14, and posing a child in a state of nudity. "There are no more disturbing crimes than the abuse of our children, and this life sentence is reflective of the devastation that this defendant inflicted on these children and their families," Middlesex District Attorney Gerard Leone said in a statement. Leone said the judge in the case sent " a clear message that those who are found guilty of such despicable crimes against our children will be punished as such - and a life sentence is certainly appropriate based on the heinous nature of these crimes and the extreme vulnerability of these victims." Duffy abused one of the young girls for nearly four years, beginning when she was 12 years old. The assaults occurred at his home on various occasions. Prosecutors would not describe his relationship with the two young girls, but said they knew each other when the rapes began. He was indicted in May of 2006.
