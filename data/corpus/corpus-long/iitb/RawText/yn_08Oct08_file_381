(AP) - A man accused of concealing a python and tortoise taken from Norman's Little River Zoo has been charged in Cleveland County District Court. Cody Daniel Hawkins, 24, was charged Tuesday with knowingly concealing stolen property, cruelty to animals and unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous drug. The cruelty charge stems from a kitten that was placed in the python's cage and eaten. Hawkins is also accused of having the drug Ecstasy in a pocket while being searched at Cleveland County Jail. The animals were returned to the zoo following Hawkins' arrest at his home on Sept. 24. But the 12-foot-long albino Burmese python named Merlin was taken again three days later. It was returned anonymously on Monday. Information from: The Oklahoman, Copyright 2008 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
