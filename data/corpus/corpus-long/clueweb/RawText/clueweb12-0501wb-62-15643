If the finals were played today
August 20th 2006 07:39
West Coast v Fremantle (Subiaco Oval)
Wouldn't this be something to salivate for Western Australian football fans, arguably the two form sides in the competition, and perhaps we will get a sneak preview of what is to come in September next Sunday.
Adelaide v Melbourne (AAMI Stadium)
The Crows are struggling, no matter how much Neil Craig and the match committee try to hide from it, the cold hard facts are there. Adelaide have lost three of their past four, were lucky to get away with the points against the Magpies a fortnight ago on their own home ground and surrendered a five-goal lead to the Bulldogs yesterday.
The Demons returned to their best today at the G, and represent the great white hope of Victorian football. On their day and when they are playing as a team are as good as anyone in the competition.
Injuries to Rivers and Bate could prove costly, but with Pickett to return from a hamstring injury and Robertson and Davey to be better for the run today, the Dees represent a big danger.
Sydney v Western Bulldogs (SCG)
The Swans were disappointing at Skilled Stadium yesterday and blew a golden opportunity to cement a spot in the top four, was it a minor abberation, we'lll soon see.
The Doggies were extremely impressive yesterday against the Crows and like the Dees are capable of knocking any side off if they back their running brand of football.
Collingwood v St Kilda (MCG)
The Pies got out of jail against Port at AAMI on Friday night, while the Saints were bitterly disappointing in their 58-point drubbing at the hands of Fremantle.
The Saints clearly lack pace through the midfield and have a rising injury toll and doubts over whether or not Aaron Hamill will return.
Even if he does you would expect him to struggle given the amount of football he has missed.
Hard to pick a winner in this one, with neither side being in particularly good form in recent weeks.
