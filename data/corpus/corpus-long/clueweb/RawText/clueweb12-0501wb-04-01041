Eastern KY counties developing multi-county trail system
November 18th, 2011
ECO ECONOMY: Eastern Kentucky communities are joining forces to develop a trail system through several counties. Neighboring West Virginia communities are already seeing benefits from development of the Hatfield and McCoy Trail System, which attracts thousands of tourists and generates millions in revenue each year. This photo was taken during the 2011 Trailfest in Gilbert, W.Va.
PIKEVILLE – Counties throughout eastern Kentucky plan to boost the economy by developing and promoting adventure tourism activities.
Big Sandy Area Development Director Sandy Runyon, who has worked with local leaders to establish trail systems in eastern Kentucky for a number of years, reports that officials in Breathitt, Clay, Knott, Leslie, Bell, Letcher, Perry, Owsley and Harlan counties have worked together for quite some time to develop a trail system that would attract ATV riders, horse enthusiasts, hikers and others into eastern Kentucky.
Runyon explained that those counties have entered into an interlocal agreement regarding the trail system, with the understanding that each county is responsible for trail development and maintenance in their counties. Officials in these counties also agree that counties would assist each other with maintenance or other issues on neighboring properties, with the understanding that counties won't be billed for that service and with goal of eventually connecting all trails together in one large system.
The Pike County Fiscal Court is the first of several Big Sandy area counties to become a part of the initiative by passing a resolution to join the multi-county effort during a Nov. 1 meeting. Although Pike county officials talked about developing a trail system to mimic the successful Hatfield-McCoy ATV Trail system in West Virginia, Runyon believes the interlocal agreement, once it is finalized, will encompass all types of trails and trail-based activities.
The first step is for Fiscal Courts in those counties to pass a resolution stating the county's intent on participating. Thereafter, county attorneys will hash out a finalized interlocal agreement that suits the needs of all counties. The Big Sandy ADD is currently preparing resolutions for other Big Sandy counties.
“I'm not sure how many counties will sign on,” Runyon said. “But we know that Pike, Floyd, Magoffin and Martin counties are interested and we expect that Johnson County will also be interested. Our goal is to have any kind of agreement they enter into to include all trails.”
Once the interlocal agreement between the counties is finalized, Runyon said it is likely that individual counties will be responsible for obtaining land-use permits from residents, which could be a “huge endeavor” in counties like Pike County, where officials have identified 200 property owners along one potential trail route.
Runyon said the biggest issue in connecting eastern Kentucky trails is the liability that property owners face when they allow the public to come onto their property.
There has been some effort at the state level to pass legislation to ease the property liability burden, but the state's tort law, allowing people to sue for various reasons, may prevent further success of that effort.
One bill passed the House last year, but it died without a vote in the Senate.
Runyon said the laws enacted by the legislature show progress.
“I do think there is a way around all of this if everybody can work together, and they truly do work together, and try to add all the needs of everybody involved,” she said. “I think we can make some progress.”
Areas like Harlan, Bell, Knott Leslie and Knott counties found ways around the liability issues and are able to market trails and host large-scale trail events because a large corporate landowner or private landowners with large, usable tracks of property provided a long-term lease to the county.
“Bell County is the new kid on the block,” Runyon said. “There was a company there that leased 7,600 acres to the county. They held an ATV event there three weeks ago that attracted 3,000 riders. So, it's possible to do this.”
Runyon said the local residents contacted by the Big Sandy ADD have reported that they are excited about the potential.
“The only resistance we see is the unknown,” she said. “If every county develops a block of property and show the locals that it will work, that people will come in here to ride these trails and there is economic benefit to that, then I think local landowners will want to get involved.”
She is asking all counties to assess properties that might be available for trail development.
The multi-county coalition will make the region more eligible to receive multi-county coal severance tax funds and grant funding for trail development projects, Runyon explained.
“We truly believe here that tourism will be an economic development engine,” Runyon said. “It won't be the only engine, but it will be a major economic tool for this region.”
