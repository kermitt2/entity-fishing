Books & Technology Roundup
Book publishers have been on our minds since our post on 25 Lessons Publishers Can Teach Startups. In particular because Digital Book World took place, then O’Reilly Tools of Change, plus the National Book Count data was released and our client Canadian Bookshelf announced today that Amazon.ca will be its lead sponsor for 2012 and they are rebranding as The 49th Shelf. Here’s the big news in books.
Digital Book World Conference
Digital Book World keeps a running commentary on their blog of insights into publishing in the 21st century. Following the conference, attendees posted a number of summaries of the sessions and keynotes on various sites. Here are the standout factoids and anecdotes in my mind.
Publisher optimism about the digital evolution has lessened over the past year. 72% of publishers feel they can be competitive in the new digital market (down 83% from last year).
Ebook sales increased 17% in 2011. For top publishers, 15% of their book sales were from digital in 2011. There is a lot of variation across publisher and dependent on the genre of books published.
Consumer preference for reading ebooks shows 35% prefer dedicated e-readers (Kindle), 31% tablets (iPad), and 30% reading tablets (Fire, NookColor, Vox).
Also of note, Sourcebooks announced their experimentation with an agile publishing model.
O’Reilly Tools of Change Conference
O'Reilly Media’s Tools of Change conference returned to New York with a stellar line up of publishing innovators and technologists to talk about the present and future of publishing. This year’s TOC kicked off with keynote presenter LeVar Burton. Burton heads a startup multimedia children’s publishing venture called RRKidz that is based on his work hosting PBS’s Reading Rainbow program. Watch the keynote and other presentations from the conference.
Tim Carmody, Wired Magazine, also presented on the Future of Reading, from Avant-Garde Poetry to Sportscenter.

National Book Count
25 books will have been sold or circulated in Canada by the time you read this sentence.
The above was Mark Medley’s opening for his National Post article on the results of the National Reading Campaign’s National Book Count. Read the full article: “National Book Count suggests Canada Reads”
It’s true. The numbers are in. Canada Reads. And based on our experience with client Canadian Bookshelf, there’s a strong audience for Canadian-authored titles.
Canadian Bookshelf Announces Amazon.ca As Lead Sponsor for 2012 and Rebrands as The 49th Shelf
Announced today:
Canadian books are getting a well-deserved boost today. Canadian Bookshelf announced Amazon.ca as its lead sponsor for 2012, and that the book community website will now offer expanded features and book listings under the new name The 49th Shelf. http://49thShelf.com
Read the Full Press Release ...
As book fans and supporters of the Canadian publishing industry, I’m looking forward to this next chapter with 49th Shelf.

Getting to +1: A Social Approach to Winning Support for Search Marketing
Last night I presented to the SEMPO Vancouver meetup group on the different perspectives of generalists and specialists when it comes to Search Marketing.
In summary, marketing generalists are under a ton of pressure to understand and create effective marketing strategies that address the growth of marketing channels and device choices, on top of dealing with the explosion of marketing data and financial constraints. Search marketing specialists can play a key strategic role in answering business questions like “how should I allocate budget among each marketing channel,” “how can I get more leads,” and “what can I do to get more sales?” But specialists need to understand the social approach to winning support from generalists.
This presentation offers tips for Search Specialists looking to gain support from clients, managers, executives and other generalists.

Boxcar Marketing At BookNet Canada’s Tech Forum
The Vancouver Sun recently published an article by Sean Cranbury that highlights Monique Trottier’s presentation at BNC Technology Forum 2011. Tech Forum is an annual event that showcases experts and visionaries from the international publishing and bookselling scene. This year’s focus was on practical insights on the digital space and Monique presented on measuring the success of your online marketing campaigns.
Organized by BookNet’s Samantha Francis, the conference opened with keynote speaker Mitch Joel, President of Twist Image and author of Six Pixels of Separation.
Other speakers included Patrick Brown from Goodreads, Colin Robinson of Or Books, and Alex Jansen of Pop Sandbox. See the complete list of speakers.
In a summary of the day, the Vancouver Sun article mentions Monique’s presentation, titled “Beyond Fans and Followers, Measuring Your Online Marketing Campaigns.”
[Trottier] proceeded to demonstrate how tools like Google Analytics can be used to measure the success of online marketing campaigns.
The twitter hashtag #TechForum11 was tending at this time and many of the tweets that emerged from Monique’s session lauded her generous attention to detail.
Jack Illingworth, Executive Director of Literary Press Group Canada tweeted: “[Monique] has said more in 9 minutes that most do in an hour” while freelance editor Laura Godrey summed up the general mood by tweeting “@somisguided is totally #crushingit at #techforum11. I need to learn to use Google Analytics…”
It was the kind of presentation that seeks to be the example that others will follow in terms of commitment, content and practical value for the audience and it was arguably the best session of the day.
Thank you to Sean Cranbury for the very flattering representation of the session!

Georgia Straight: Vancouver book scene reshaped by online communities
On Monday the Georgia Straight posted an article on how
Vancouver’s book scene is being reshaped by online communities.
The article looks at how the web is changing the publishing industry and readers’ relationship to books. Vancouver, in particular, is playing a role in changing the Canadian publishing landscape with events like the Vancouver Book Club, the W2 Real Vancouver Writers’ & Culture Series and BookCamp Vancouver.
Monique, who the article states, “has played an instrumental role in the digital growth of Canada’s publishing industry” was interviewed for the article:
When Trottier started at Raincoast, she was one of only a handful of people in publishing who worked online.
“Even at that stage, it was clear that the hierarchy of conversation about books was collapsing,” Trottier told the Straight at a Kitsilano coffee shop.
Publishers—and only publishers—used to engage with media and booksellers, and then media and booksellers would communicate with retail buyers and the public. “The web has really collapsed that,” Trottier said. “The conversation happens between readers and between writers, and then directly between readers and writers and publishers.”
While social media allow publishers to listen more closely to their markets, Trottier acknowledges that they’re not the silver bullet that will save the industry. “Publishers are going to save themselves when they figure out what their new business model is,” she said.

Interesting Vancouver 2010
Friday, October 8 was Vancouver’s 3rd Interesting event.
Interesting was founded in London, UK by Russell Davies and now has chapters around the world. Friend and former Vancouverite Brett Macfarlane founded the Vancouver chapter and kicked off the event this year in a pre-recorded statement from Uraguay. If that wasn’t interesting enough, the evening progressed through a series of 5- and 10-minute presentations on the jazz scene in Vancouver, yarn bombing, the coincidence problem, how to take (and throw) your first punch to the face, biodynamic farming, transgender identity, the sex trade in Vancouver, food sourcing, the beauty in the data of 50K camera-phone photos taken by one guy, third spaces such as the Museum of Vancouver, and the notes of spaces in music.
Interesting, unexpected, ordinary and extraordinary.
Jer Thorp was one of my favourite speakers from Interesting Vancouver 2009.

I also had the pleasure of speaking at last year’s event. Here’s part of my presentation on natural perfume, the brain and how our sense of scent works.
