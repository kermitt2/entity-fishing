I'm not in high school anymore but I do like to follow and learn from around the country from other Marching Bands and their marching shows?
What is your competitive marching show you are performing this fall?
So I don't just limit this to just high schoolers, For people not in a marching band, what is a show you WISH you were performing this fall?

My college is doing The Planets as their marching band show. :)
Auditions are on Friday actually.
Clarinet 1 part makes me cry a little inside.
EDIT:
My old hs is doing Robin Hood: Prince of thieves, and their ballad is Training Montage from Highlander.

I'm just an alum that techs with the battery from time to time, but their show is "The Hero: The Battle of Good vs. Evil," featuring original arrangements of music from X-men, "One Day I'll Fly Away" from Moulin Rouge, Batman, Superman, and I think one other source that I can't recall. It's their best show design I've ever seen (and I'm jealous). They're gonna clean house in Single-A around their neck of the woods. . .
