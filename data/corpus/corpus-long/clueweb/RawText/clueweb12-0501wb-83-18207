After first loss, LMS has no problem beating E.O. Coffman
(09/30/11)
After suffering their first setback of the season with a 14-6 loss to Spring Hill five days earlier, the Lewisburg Middle School Tigers (5-1) quickly righted the ship by pounding the E.O. Coffman Panthers 39-8 at home on Thursday.
EO Coffman had defeated Spring Hill 15-14 two weeks earlier, but proved to be no match for LMS, as the Tigers forged a 26-0 lead in the first half with the help of two special teams touchdowns before opening up a 39-0 lead late in the third quarter en route to claiming the 31-point victory.
"I was pleased with the way we bounced back," said Lewisburg coach Jeff Morton. "That team beat Spring Hill so it was a good win. We were flat last week against Spring Hill, but tonight we came out with a lot of emotion and played well."
