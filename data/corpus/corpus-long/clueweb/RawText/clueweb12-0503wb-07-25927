Long
Branch, NY Tornado
September 15, 1912
How Fatalities Occurred
The one man instantly killed by the storm was
Wilson Mathewson.
He was a farmer, 53 years of age, and lived
about three-quarters of a mile from Long Branch.
With his wife, Mr. Mathewson had stepped from a
car that had carried him from the city to Long
Branch.  They were both in the trolley
station at Long Branch preparing to go to their
home.  When the wind caught the trolley
station in its grasp, Mr. Mathewson was carried
along with it.  He was struck by the
timbers.  His body was caught in the grip
of the tornado and carried a distance of about
100 feet from where the station had stood.
He was found on a hillside and died before help
reached him.
GW Dopp
of Fulton and Charles Chapman of Pitcher hill
died in hospitals, the former in Genesee
hospital and the latter at St. Joseph's.
Mr. Dopp was employed as a motorman on the
Syracuse, Lakeshore & Northern railroad.
Dopp was in his car, which was at the Long
Branch shop.  When the storm came he was
engaged in cleaning the front window in order
that he might have a better view of the tracks
when the trip was resumed.
The car was close beside the waiting room,
and when it crashed down the roof of the
structure crashed into the car.  Dopp had
no chance to escape.  His chest and skull
were crushed.  He was rushed to the city in
an automobile and then taken to the Genesee
hospital, where he died at 10:30 o'clock.
Dopp was 22 years of age.
Charles Chapman
died at St. Joseph's hospital.  Mr. Chapman
ran a store at Pitcher Hill.  The house and
store were under the same roof. When the storm
hit the building Mr. Chapman tried to get to a
door to close it.  As he did he was caught
beneath the falling timbers of the house and
crushed.  His chest was crushed and he
received internal injuries that proved fatal.
Mr. Chapman was 45 year of age and is survived
by his wife and several children.

TORNADO WRECKED SUMMER COTTAGES
Sunday's Storm Played Havoc Along Seneca
River
Visitor is Badly Hurt
Reuben Dudley
said to have sustained fractured skull -- Union
men offer their services to rebuild damaged
buildings.
Reuben Dudley,
a visitor at one of the cottages on the Seneca
Road is said to have suffered a fracture of the
skull as a result of the tornado of Sunday.
Reports of the damage to the cottages along the
Seneca river today showed that the tornado
played great havoc there and many persons
escaped death and injury only by good fortune.
Robert Prager
[?] a cottager near Long Branch, had tied his
motorboat to a tree near his cottage.  The
tornado uprooted the tree and [illegible] upon
his cottage, carrying the motorboat ten feet in
to the air where it hung by the rope.
A cottage owned by
Clarence Dunn was completely wrecked.
This cottage was about 100 feet from another
cottage where Mr. Dunn's family were huddled in
fear as trees crashed down in the woods about
hem.  Trees along the river, leaning over,
were hurled over in the opposite direction.
Mr. Dudley
was struck by an iron flag pole which broke into
three pieces while he was trying to fasten a
motorboat.
Syracuse Herald, Syracuse, NY 18 Sept
1912
A fatal accident to
Samuel Smith, who lived at Park and
Center streets, is directly attributable to the
tornado.  He started to walk from Long
Branch to this city, was hit by a trolley car
near Pleasant Beach and when brought to St. Joseph's hospital several hours afterwards, it
was found that his skull was fractured and his
right arm had been severed at the shoulder.
Syracuse Herald, Syracuse, NY 16 Sept
1912
North of Liverpool the storm first struck the
farm of Bartholomew
Smith, blowing the roof off the barn,
blowing in windows of the house and whirling
furniture about.
HM Younglove's greenhouse across
the road was blown to pieces.  Mowing
machines were carried [illegible] feet by the
wind.....
The home of Thomas
E. Bennett was torn from its stone
foundation and carried at least twenty feet.
Mr. Bennett and his wife were unhurt.  He
tried to protect her from heavy beams and boards
that fell about them and his shoulder was
dislocated and his chest injured, though it is
not thought seriously.  Across from the
Bennett's
Lewis Keith's
home was destroyed and the aged man and his
family narrowly escaped death or serious injury.
Several tons of coal in a woodshed were moved
several feet, woodshed and all.
At Pitcher Hill among the wrecked buildings
are the house and barn of
Mr. Chapman,
the home of HU
Wendell, home and barn of
William Michaels,
the schoolhouse and other buildings to say
nothing of those that are unroofed or twisted.
The farmers there are stared in the face by
ruin.
Mr. Chapman
was the only one downstairs when his home was
demolished and he was killed. His family and
friends were upstairs and were only
comparatively slightly hurt.  He was
crushed by heavy timbers under one corner of the
store.  He had evidently been trying to
close the door when the wind tumbled the
building down. Mrs. Chapman, who was slightly
injured by falling bricks and timber was
frantic.  Girls upstairs were hurled down
with the house and cut and bruised.
After the building fell
Miss Laura Hazelmyre, a guest at
the house, climbed out and was seen standing on
the roof covered with blood.  She had saved
the life of Edna Odin, a girl of 12, by throwing
her out of the window though how or why she did
it she does not know.  Miss Hazelmyre was
bruised and lacerated all over her body an a
large piece was torn from one of her limbs but
she was able to be up this morning and to limp
along the road.  Miss Hazlemyre is only
about 18 years old and other in the house,
excepting Mrs. Chapman
and Mrs. Louis Haber,
were all children.
All were upstairs save
Mr. Chapman.  Mrs. Chapman
crazed by the terrible disaster, managed to get
out of the wreckage that was once a home an
tried to find her husband.  He was found
crushed and died in St. Joseph's hospital.
It was necessary to saw away several [illegible]
before Mr. Chapman could be gotten out.
Jacob Kronder,
and employee of William
Merrell at Pitcher Hill, is likely to
die.  He and Merrell were in the barn when
the cyclone came.  A beam struck Kronder
and he went down.  The wind seemed to pick
up the barn and carry it and Mr. Merrell rode in
the storm, praying to God as he was carried
along.  Wagons were driven pas him by the
wind.  In an instant it was over, but it
seemed like years.  Merrell's home and
furniture and several barns were destroyed.
John Wilkinson
was between his house and barn when the cyclone
struck him and he was knocked down by flying
timbers.  His injuries while not apparently
serious may develop seriously.
William Michaels's
house, just south of the
Chapman's place, is twisted out of
shape and his barn is completely demolished.
In the wreckage of the barn lies a white horse,
killed by the falling timbers.  The house
outside does not look so bad but inside it is a
wreck.  It is twisted out of shape,
plastering is fallen everywhere.  Mr.
Michaels was going from the barn to the house
and the wind blew him against the house with
great force...
The homes of Earl
Benz and
Albert Jewell are in ruins.
Fred Zwicki
lost part of his house and all of his barn.
A big wagon was hurled through his henhouse.
Willard Davis
lost the roof from his house and not a shred was
left together of his barn.  In his
[illegible] are dead chickens by the score.
His family of children were in the house but
were not hurt.  Mr. Davis was in a lot near
his home and was knocked down by the wind, while
flying timbers were carried over his head.
He was not injured.
The home of Sidney
Price and his barn were wrecked.
One cow as left in the cellar of the barn this
morning and neighbors and friends tried to get
it out.  Another cow was hurt and
spectators begged that it be killed. It is said
that it would be.  The front of Mr. Price's
house was torn off and only two rooms were
undamaged.  From the front upstairs a
little picture could be seen this morning
evidently hurled from the wall and fastened by
the wind across the end of a partition that it
had torn off.
