Foreign trips fall as durations rise
Jul 23 2010
By Holiday Hypermarket
Past summers have seen British holidaymakers frantically searching for foreign beach holiday deals year after year.
This overseas holiday trend has been growing at an average rate of 4% per year over the past 25 years, with tourists heading to the UK from overseas growing at an average of 3.2%.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that this trend changed in 2009, with 58.6 million UK holidaymakers heading overseas, a 15% drop on 2008. Overseas residents heading to the UK on holiday also fell from 31.9 million in 2008 to 29.9 million in 2009, a slower drop of 6.3%.
Surprisingly this drop is not exclusive to holidaymakers cutting back on their beach holiday deals abroad. In fact business visits were the hardest hit, falling by 23% among UK residents travelling abroad on business, compared to 19% of overseas business travellers heading here to the UK.
Holiday visits to relatives abroad by UK residents fell at a lower rate of 6.5% and to friends abroad at a higher 15%. The number of overseas residents visiting the UK to see friends and family also dropped by 9.7%.
ONS reported that it is not all doom and gloom for some sectors of the UK though, as expenditure of overseas visitors during their UK holidays grew from £16.3 billion in 2008 to £16.6 billion last year in 2009, with UK residents’ expenditure abroad falling by £5.1 billion due to the current economic climate.
The number of overseas travellers visiting London during their stay here fell by 3.7% in 2009, with visits to Scotland rising slightly during this time. Edinburgh, Manchester and Birmingham remain popular destinations for overseas visitors to the UK.
The most common reason for British residents travelling abroad is still for annual holidays. They also dominate spending with £21.8 billion of the £31.7 billion total expenditure abroad in 2009 being for holiday purposes.
Throughout 2009 Egypt, Jamaica and Lithuania received an increase in visits from UK residents, continuing the overall trend in recent years. Mexico was exempt from this increase as visitors there dropped substantially by 41%.
UK residents may be taking fewer beach holidays abroad but there has been a rise in the duration of holidays in recent years. In 2007 the average stay was 9.9 nights rising to 10.2 nights in 2008 and even further to 10.5 nights in 2009.
This shows that although holidaymakers are cutting back on the amount of foreign trips they are taking, many are making up for this by increasing the time that they spend away on holiday.
