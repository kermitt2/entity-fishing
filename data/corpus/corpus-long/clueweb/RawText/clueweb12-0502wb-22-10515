He's back: Richie Hall named Rider DC
February 01, 2011

THE CANADIAN PRESSRegina -- It was a frigid -38 C with the wind chill at Mosaic Stadium, but there was a warm welcome inside the Saskatchewan Roughriders' locker-room for Richie Hall.The CFL club announced Tuesday that Hall will return to Saskatchewan as defensive co-ordinator.“It feels good,” a grinning Hall told reporters.“It feels a little intimidating just because they've have so much success the last couple of years, going to Grey Cup two years (in a row). You feel that you want to continue that tradition that they have already established.”Hall was a part of the green and white coaching staff for 15 seasons, including eight as defensive co-ordinator. He helped the Riders win the Grey Cup in 2007.Hall left Saskatchewan in 2009 to become head coach and defensive co-ordinator of the Edmonton Eskimos. He was embraced by Edmonton fans and players alike for his ready grin and relentless optimism, but that wasn't enough to offset a losing record.He was fired by the Eskimos in November after Edmonton finished with a 7-11 record last season and missed the playoffs.It was a learning experience.“I think it's changed you, but I don't know if it changed me because I've been the head coach. I think it's just the last two years of experience, as far as the things that I've endured, that makes you either bitter or makes you better. And I always think that your experiences make you a better person,” said Hall.“I like to think that I'm better today than I was yesterday.”Before moving into coaching, Hall spent nine years playing in the CFL, including four seasons with the Roughriders from 1988 to 1991. He was a key member of the Roughriders' 1989 Grey Cup championship team.Hall said he doesn't think going from a head coach position to defensive co-ordinator is a step backwards.“I've always looked at it as just to have the opportunity to do something that you enjoy doing and that's coaching,” he said.“Whether it's being a position coach, whether it's being a co-ordinator or whether it's being a head coach, I get the luxury of doing something that I enjoy doing. It doesn't matter what my role is, but to be able to coach I think that's a lot of fun.”Riders GM Brendan Taman said Hall's record speaks for itself.“He's pretty successful wherever he's been and as a defensive coach, whenever teams I've (been with) played against him, it was tough. He's a good coach and obviously was in the search for the head coaching job so we think a lot of him,” said Taman.The head coaching job in Saskatchewan opened up in December when Ken Miller announced he would be stepping down to focus on his position as the Riders' vice-president of football operations.Last month, the Riders handed the reins to Greg Marshall.Marshall started coaching in the CFL in 1994 in Saskatchewan. He was the team's defensive line coach for two seasons before adding the title of defensive co-ordinator. Marshall left the Riders in 1999 for other coaching positions and was most recently the Hamilton Tiger-Cats' defensive co-ordinator for the past two seasons.Hall, who worked with Marshall in Saskatchewan, said they have a good relationship.“Ever since we departed in 2000, we've always had the desire to work together again,” said Hall.“I know I'm very excited about it and he's very excited. You know it's interesting because we've been apart for so long, now to come back together and to see what we've learned. We've kind of gone in different avenues and we all came in together and now we're reunited and I think it's going to be fun.”

The hirings of Hall and Dickenson are making the coaching staff or the Riders look extremely strong!

Good for Richie!
He is a standup guy and a fine coach who was the victim of bad circumstances.
