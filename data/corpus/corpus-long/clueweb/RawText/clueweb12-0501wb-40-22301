Pattinson Will
Come Out Fighting
Stuart Broad is
confident his Nottinghamshire and England team-mate
Darren Pattinson will fight back from losing his
Test place after just one match, as reported by
Ladbrokes.
Twenty-nine-year-old
Pattinson's unexpected debut against South Africa
at Headingley this month was accompanied by jibes
about the wisdom of his sudden
elevation.
The Headingley
experience proved to be a tough one for a bowler
with only 11 previous first-class matches under his
belt - and as he went wicketless on his return for
Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on Wednesday, it
was easy to fear for his state of mind.
Broad, however,
has no doubt the Grimsby-born but Australian-raised
seamer will be back among the wickets with a
vengeance soon - determined to reclaim his England
place.

After Durham had
been bowled out for 266 - despite 85 from former
Nottinghamshire batsman Will Smith - by Charlie Shreck (four for 69) and Broad (three for 47) on
day one of the top-of-the-table LV County
Championship Division One match, the latter turned
his attention to Pattinson.
"He's always
upbeat. He's a lovely bloke and he got dealt with
harshly by the press, because he bowled well for a
Test debut on a very flat wicket." Broad recalled.
"He's come out fighting; he's bowled well so far in
this match, and we hope he can continue bowling
well for Notts - because he's been one of our main
strike bowlers in our run so far this
season."
Pattinson's
ambitions came into question again yesterday when
reports surfaced from Down Under that he would
prefer to play for Victoria this winter than tour
with England, if selected.
He and
Nottinghamshire quickly refuted those suggestions,
however - and Broad confirmed: "He's smiling and
he's still got international ambition. I'm sure
he'll be aiming for some winter tours or Champions Trophy."
Broad himself had
a strange day - left out by England on the morning
of the third Test at Edgbaston and rerouted to help
Nottinghamshire's title challenge.
It did not appear
to bother him.
"Obviously it's a
bit odd having a drive between games when they've
just started." said the 22-year-old. "But I did it
a bit last year, when I was 12th man for India,
shooting up motorways and then bowling in the
afternoons. It is something I'm kind of used to,
and obviously it is very enjoyable to have bowled
them Durham out by the end of play and be
in a very strong position. Charlie Shreck
