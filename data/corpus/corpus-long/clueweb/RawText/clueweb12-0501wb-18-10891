Albion Rovers agree deal for striker
Jun 8 2011 By Colin Paterson
Paul Martin
ALBION ROVERS boss Paul Martin says there is plenty to come from new signing Andy Scott.
Former Alloa Athletic ace Scott will put pen to paper on a one-year deal in the coming days after leaving the Wasps.
The 26-year-old is being added to the Cliftonhill squad as a forward with Martin confident he will produce the goods.
"I’m pleased to get him on board as I feel he has definitely got something," the manager told Advertiser Sport.
"Andy has a good goalscoring record in the Juniors and will provide another presence up- front.
"He is a typical signing of mine in many ways. I feel we can get more out of him in the right environment."
Martin has been busy re-signing the majority of last season’s Third Division play-off winning squad.
Captain Ciaran Donnelly and player/assistant manager Todd Lumsden head a list of 14 players who have committed their futures to the club.
The other players are Scott Chaplain, Alan Reid, Chris Boyle, Chris Hamilton, Robert Love, Tony Stevenson, Danny Ferry, Jamie Gilmartin Michael McGowan, Stevie Canning, Iain Smith and Marc Pollock.
Martin has yet to speak to hitman John Gemmell as he is on holiday in Mexico.
"The board gave me a little bit extra money and that has allowed me to keep the squad together," he added.
"Everyone I’ve spoken to wants to stay and now it’s just a case of running around and getting the contracts signed."
Meanwhile, Rovers’ move for East Kilbride Thistle ace Barry Russell has hit a snag after the player was told of apparent interest from Partick Thistle.
Martin said: "There has been a complication but if Barry is good enough for Partick Thistle, we’ll help him get to Partick Thistle.
"We’re here to develop players, not stand in their way."
*KEEPER Derek Gaston will sign a new contract with Rovers - if he fails to win a full- time deal at Partick.
The Bargeddie goalie will join the First Division outfit for a fortnight of pre-season training.
*ROVERS will travel to the Inverclyde Regional Sports Centre on Saturday, July 9 to face Queen's Park in a pre- season friendly.
Martin’s men will then visit Junior outfits Lanark United
