With the twenty-third pick in the Canal Street Chronicles community mock draft, the ew England Patriots select...
Malcolm Jenkins, CB, Ohio State
Here at CSC, we are all familiar with Jenkins. He's been at the top of our draft boards for the past couple years. He's got the size and ability to succeed in the NFL. I don't feel the need to elaborate on that. We like him. We want him. But in case you forgot, diehardbermysaints made a great FanPost enumerating the 3 reasons to pick Jenkins.Some may argue LB is the Patriots most pressing need. However, with Maualuga and Cushing off the board, I don't believe the Pats should reach for Lauranitis, Matthews, or Sintim at this point. Each one of them would fill a nice need for the Pats; Lauranitis with the leadership, Matthews with the pass rush, and Sintim with the experience in the 3-4. Despite this, one of them should still be available when the Pats pick again at #34, making Jenkins a better value for this pick. Aside from that, a nucleus of Mayo and Adalius Thomas is still serviceable when surrounded by midlevel talent. I don't really see the Patriots going any other direction here. Their offense is solid. The top OL prospects are gone. Their pass rush and defensive line could use some work, but I think that need would be better fulfilled later this draft. So, this pick came to the man us Saints fans have longed for since Jason David first stepped on the field in black and gold. It's a damn shame I had to give him to the Patriots.
The Atlanta Falcons are now on the clock...

Come on guys, I see the “GAAAs” outnumber the “Booms!” in the poll. Who doesn’t agree with this pick?

If the Pats really do get him, I am going to be bitterly disappointed.
