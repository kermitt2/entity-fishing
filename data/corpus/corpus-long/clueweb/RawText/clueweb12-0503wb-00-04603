13-15 West Street, Elizabeth Peabody's mid-19th century home, bookstore, and foreign circulating library, is the newest Boston Landmark.  The building was a meeting place for the Transcendentalist movement and hosted many prominent writers, philosophers, and artists, including Margaret Fuller, Henry David Thoreau, and Nathaniel Hawthorne.
13-15 West Street Report »
As one of the oldest American cities, Boston has long played an important role in the development of the nation.  It is home to a wealth of important cultural resources: there are more than 8,000 properties located with the City’s nine local Historic Districts or designated as individual Boston Landmarks.  These are the buildings, structures, sites, and areas that inform us about the people that have lived and worked in Boston and the events that have shaped the City from its beginning to the present.The Boston Landmarks Commission, along with the local Historic District Commissions, serves as the City’s steward of Boston’s historic buildings, places, and neighborhoods.  The BLC and the Historic District Commissions, all headquartered within the Environment Department, provide information and assistance concerning the regulatory process, historic preservation planning, archaeology, sources for historical information, and technical assistance.This website is provided as a service to those interested in Boston’s historic buildings, districts, and sites. It is not a substitute for the advice of staff, nor is it a substitute for formal review of an application by the applicable Commission, as required by law. BLC staff can verify if your property has local Landmark status or any other historic status, and if so, what that means in terms of protection and regulation.  We may also be able to provide technical information if you are beginning an historic rehabilitation project on your building or grounds.What is the BLC?JurisdictionIn 1975, state legislation (Chapter 772, MGL 1975, as amended) created the Boston Landmarks Commission as Boston's City-wide historic preservation agency.  The many functions it performs include identifying and preserving historic properties, reviewing development and demolition activities proposed in the City, providing public information and assistance on historic preservation practices, and providing staff support to the local Historic District Commissions.  The BLC also administers the City's Demolition Delay process, Article 85 of the Zoning Code.MembersView List of Members
