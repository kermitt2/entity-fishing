Message:Chris said that Saturday is the Dakota day. He is going to be there on Friday and rent ATV's with the family. I said I will do the day trip down and back. I might have a truck or two that wants to go also. Lets plan on meeting in Watsonville and follow each other down their. Leave around 6:00 to get there by 9:00.
No camping, there is no more reservations left.

Message:Sorry guys I was Ill yesterday.
Just so you know if you start to feel like your are gonna throw up you probably are.
My son started a 24 hour stomach flu Saturday night.
I got it and hated it!
Yes, Saturday morning we can meet when ever you want.
I hear the place will be packed because of sand rail races or something.
I am staying in SLO Thurs and Fri night.
I will leave saturday late afternoon.
Off road world group will be hooking up with us.
Umm, I am renting ATV's for the kids Friday from 1000-1400 if anyone is there Friday let me know.
By the way I probably will still have Hollister Mud on my truck.
I have not been able to spend quality time with my truck yet.
I am leaving for San Diego for a family event tomorrow so this weekend is out and I have guys still waitng for video from last week.
Let me know Monday who's in.

Message:Cool another local SLO Dakota.
I think Arthur is gonna hook up with us, he is from SLO also.
I have updated some of the video on my site.
I have added a Idle Exhaust video for good sound purposes so you can get a good idea of what the Flowmasters I have sound like on the V6.
Also added some photo's

We can meet just after the entrance where you pay to get in.
The second South entrance.
1000 works for me.
The other groups will not be in til 1pm.
Let me know if this works for you guys.
Or if you want to meet later.

Message:I think that will work. It takes me 2.5 hours to get from Watsonville to Pismo at 75 mph. So lets meet there at 6:20 and gas up and buy some snacks. I will try to get a F-150 to go with us, but he is flacky. Stuart lives in SLO so I will call him up and tell him to call some more local friends.
Kevin got $40, lets put some tow hooks on you truck! 3 work days left, you will thank me latter..:)

Message:To everyone coming out to the dunes on saturday, try and be early, if you don't have a year long pass the rangers can get a little picky about letting too many people in, and no one wants to be left out.
Saturday is going to be HUGE!
To anyone showing up or worried about coming and not seeing us or something, let me tell you it's really hard to miss a large group of dakotas on the dunes!
I will be out there in my truck...maybe for the last time, so i plan on using that darn tow strap and maybe even cranking my torsion bars this week FINALLY!
Chris, have the camera all charged up for video, i'm feelin a little crazy for this
weekend (the days you have seen me are normal days, wait till you see me crazy!)
Bluedak - are you the two tone dakota that is always covered in mud at Cuesta?
If you can make it out on saturday that would be cool, i tend to go out to the dunes a lot and i know my way around pretty well.
DakotaChris - dude, you have to come!
We will have tow-straps and wenches galor so you can wheel and never worry about being left out there, plus i've never seen a cool 2WD dakota in person and i'm diein to see one!
THRASH1 - look forward to meetin you, i drive the Graphite SXT 4X4 CC when you get there.
Hope you guys all feel crazy too, i hate being the only dumb...opps...i mean, adventurous wheeler with lack of common sense and brain power out there.
Balls and guts can get you places, but nothing matches good old ignorance and youthful stupidity!
2002 SXT 4X4 CC 3.9L 3.92LSD, might be trucks last outing too!

Message:Sounds like this will be the trip!
Arthur, can we buy a bunch of passes Saturday morning and just give them to the guys when we meet at the front?
I will not be thrashin to much this trip.
I plan on getting allot of great video so I can start working on my Video project.
Plus I think I have a problem brewin in the front end.
Maybe CV joints or bearings or???
I am still trying to pin point where the noise is coming from but it is a rolling type of scraping I thought it was mud in the rotors or something but I have got ALL of the mud off and I still get the noise.
Sounds like front Right side.
I am gonna get the book out and see what kind of checks to do to check the CV joints and stuff.
Hopefully it is nothing bad.
I can not get it to the Mech til next week.
Can't wait to meet up with new Dakota owners.
I will have lots of Video time to capture.
I will still have fun too.
But no Air contest with Arthur!

Message:Rangers want one ticket per vehicle so that they can get your licence plate number. Kevin and I will be there by 9 am.
New 33's = more flotation!
Plus no front receiver to hang me up.

Message:We can meet at the most south entrance just inside after you pay to get in.
My plans have changed drastically!
I will be arriving Pismo at about 0830.
I am not staying in SLO.
This is now a day trip for me and I have a friend riding along so he can drive while I get some video shots.
I plan to leave at about sunset.
Craig and Kevin,
I plan to leave at 0600 and should be at the 156 / 101 junction at 0630 if you want to meet there and drive down together let me know.
Chris

Message:For any last minute changes here is what the plan is.
We will meet at 9 am Saturday at the second entrance (most South Entrance) just after you pay and you drive on to the beach.
You cant miss a bunch of Dakota's.
The second meet will happen at about 1230 - 100 at the same place.
Craig if you see this do you take 129 or 156 in to 101?
I should be at those points between 620 and 630 am.
I will wait at 156 just South if I do not hear from you.
If I do not hear from you I will leave by 640am.
I stop at King city First exit and the rest stop.
I will gas up at the Chevron at Shell beach so I do not run out.
Hope to see those who wanted to meet up.
