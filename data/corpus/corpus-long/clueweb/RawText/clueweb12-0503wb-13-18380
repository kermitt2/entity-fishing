10/20/10You may be familiar with our Dreamland brand, but you may not be familiar with our history. Dreamland was the dream of
Tuscaloosa, Ala. , native John “Big Daddy” Bishop.  Big Daddy opened Dreamland in 1958 off of highway 82 and Interstate 59 just south of Tuscaloosa in the
Jerusalem
Heights area.   Since that time and to this day, the original store still serves up Dreamland’s legendary ribs.  Our atmosphere gives you a down-home casual feel.  At the original store you will find the décor inside is warm and dark; a dining room with a big bar, booths and a pot-bellied stove; beer signs hanging from the oak beams and Christmas lights that flash all year-round.  The first store to open outside of Tuscaloosa was in
Birmingham, Ala. , in 1993.   The restaurant is nestled in the revitalized Southside neighborhood.  Dreamland’s very presence on Southside has added to the area’s transformation and economic growth.  In addition to the Tuscaloosa and Birmingham stores, you will now find six other locations in Alabama and Georgia.  Our legendary ribs and sauce are on the menu at every location, but you’ll also find the menus have been expanded to include pulled pork, barbecue chicken, hickory smoked sausage, baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad and house salads.  We also served our homemade banana pudding for dessert made with Bud’s Best vanilla wafers.
If you’re not near a Dreamland restaurant, not to worry, because we offer most of our menu items online along with our original Dreamland merchandise.  We deliver anywhere in the United States and some parts of Canada .
We hope you stop by one of our restaurants soon.  You never know who you’ll meet.
Our motto still holds true today “Ain’t Nothing Like ‘Em Nowhere!”
See you soon!

Let The Good Times Roll!
It doesn’t matter if you’re a Saints fan or Colts fan, Big Daddy says this weekend it’s time to ‘Let the Good Times Roll’ (that’s Laissez Les Bons Temps Rouler for you Saints fans).
Good times and football parties begin with family and friends gathering to watch the game.   At Dreamland we also believe that the good times begin with good food and hearty menu ideas.  Big Daddy recommends the following ‘Good Times’ Dreamland recipes for you party planners.
Saints fans you’ll have them giving you automatic first downs when you serve our Dreamland Red Beans and Rice:
Dreamland Red Beans and Rice2 cans of red kidney beans drained1 can whole peeled tomatoes undrained1 teaspoon olive oil1 small white onion, finely chopped1 small green bell pepper, finely chopped1 tablespoon garlic powder1/2 tablespoon rubbed sage1/2 tablespoon cayenne pepper3 cups long grain white rice1 lb.

Sauté the onion, bell pepper and sausage until the vegetables are tender, which takes about 4 minutes. Add the beans, tomatoes with their juice and the spices. Cook until liquid is almost at a boil then reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 20 minutes uncovered. While the food is simmering, prepare the rice. After it simmers for 20 minutes, serve the beans and sausage mixture over the rice.
