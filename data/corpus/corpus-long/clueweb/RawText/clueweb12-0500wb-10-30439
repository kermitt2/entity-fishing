“Most Difficult Result To Take This Season” – Foster
Posted on June 22, 2011 by Keith Wallace
Dundalk FC manager Ian Foster admitted that the surrender of a two-goal lead against Shamrock Rovers was “the most difficult result to take this season”, after his side played the league leaders off the Tallaght Stadium pitch for large periods, before a cruel late twist meant they had to be content with just a point. The lively Mark Griffin belatedly celebrated his 20th birthday as he had his side in cruise control with two fine finishes, only for ex-Lilywhite Chris Turner to pop up with a lifeline 11 minutes from time before Billy Dennehy struck in injury-time to earn the Hoops an undeserved 2-2 draw.
Heartbreaking
The result came following extremely disappointing defeats, for very different reasons, by Drogheda United and Saint Patrick's Athletic. But Foster felt the draw in Dublin 24 was even more galling. “It’s the most difficult result to take this season,” Ian told dundalkfc.com. “I don’t think we deserved to drop any points tonight. The players were fabulous. It was a wonderful effort from all of them. It’s heartbreaking to concede at such a late stage. You would expect when you come to the champions that they might get the ball in wide areas and break you down that way, but they’ve gone route one and stuck balls into our box. They haven’t carved us open or worked us hard. They never looked like scoring but unfortunately for us it has finished 2-2 and that’s hard to take.”
Impetus
The Lilywhites were comfortable when Griffin doubled his and his side’s advantage just past the hour mark. However, Rovers were back in it on 79 minutes when Peter Cherrie punched only as far as ex-teammate Turner who fired to an empty net from 25-yards. And Foster was particularly disappointed with how that goal was conceded. “I don’t think my ‘keeper should have come for it,” he said. “He did it against Drogheda and didn’t get there. Tonight, he got there, but if you let your centre-half deal with it, even if the centre-half doesn’t win the header, their player isn’t going to score. So, yes, I’m hugely disappointed with that because then that gives them the impetus to go and throw bodies in the box. They put both centre-halves up and unfortunately it led to the equaliser.
Proud
“I thought we had done enough,” he added, as the equaliser came with just over 90 seconds left on the clock. “We defended manfully; we won headers, we won second balls, we cleared lines. Just, unfortunately, we have been hit with a sucker-punch right in the last minute. But we have been fabulous tonight. We’re all disappointed with a point at Shamrock Rovers. The level of performance tonight was superb. We should have been 2-0 up before we first scored. We created chance after chance, we passed them to death and we made them look like the away team. I couldn’t be prouder of the players – we were excellent tonight.” Beforehand, most Dundalk fans would have taken a point. But asked if he felt it was two thrown away, Foster said: “I’d say it’s two dropped – I wouldn’t say we threw it away.
Griff praise
“The game is not over until it’s over,” he continued. “But I don’t think they deserved anything out of the game, I’ll certainly say that. I thought my players were fabulous.” Commenting on the performance of two-goal Griffin, the Liverpool-born boss was delighted with how he finished his chances and troubled Rovers captain Dan Murray and his replacement Craig Sives. “He took his goals very, very well,” Ian said. “He was a constant threat. They took off a centre-half because he couldn’t deal with him, and the fella they brought on couldn’t deal with him either. I’m delighted for Mark. His work rate and his energy are excellent and he’s a constant threat in and around the box. He took his goals very well and he could have been on the end of one or two more chances as well.”
Performances
The draw ended a run of three straight league defeats for the Lilywhites. However, last week’s display against Saint Patrick's Athletic was arguably their best home performance of the season while they produced their best away showing of the year in Tallaght. “Probably, yeah,” Foster agreed, “and unfortunately we’ve only got one point out of the two games. But if we keep playing with that level of performance then we’ll win more games than we lose. Friday (at home to Galway United) is massive and I’ve said that to the players. If they approach it with the same mentality, same energy, same work rate and same passing ability then we’ll win the game. If we go back to the Drogheda scenario then we’ll find it difficult. But our level of performance over the last two games has been wonderful.”
