Tide rallies from 14 down to top Dawgs, keep NCAA Tourney hopes alive

You know early Friday afternoon, Bama fans -- or at least the majority of Bama fans -- had one question on their minds.
How many more days until spring football?
Basketball?
Enough already. Time to move on. Oh sure, Bama was playing at the time. Its
first game in the SEC Tournament. A pivotal, super-important second-round matchup with
Georgia. In the eyes of many, this was an NCAA Tournament play-out game
for the loser, especially if that loser was Bama. And with seven minutes
left in the second half, Bama trailed by 14. As in 1-4. As in two
touchdowns. As in not coming back. As in this game's over. In fact, it
looked like the beating was going to get worse. This was Gainesville,
Part II. This was another egg-laying performance by the Tide in another
high-stakes, big stage setting.
Hmmm. AJ or Phillip. Wonder how
good Aaron Douglas is going to look at left tackle. Heard A-Day is going
to be on ESPNU this spring.
Then JaMychal Green hit a pair of free throws. Trey Thompkins hit one for Georgia. Thirteen-point lead.
Wonder why Nick Saban always wears a suit on A-Day. Wonder if he's calling a high school coach right about now regarding a recruit.

Davis jumper off the glass. An inside bucket by Green. Another bucket
by Green. Hey, it's a seven-point game now with 3:37 to play. Is it
possible that ... I mean could Bama really ... Or is this just a big
tease. If nothing else, at least Bama is making it respectable, right? A
Trevor Releford free throw. A Davis layup. Are you kidding? A
four-point game with three minutes to play.
It looked like Georgia
had awoken just in time when Thompkins converted a three-point play
with 2:49 to play to push the lead back to seven, but Bama answered
right back with a Davis trey to cut it to four again. This Tide team
wasn't going to go away. Spring football? Uh ... maybe that talk can wait. Bama
trailed by two when Releford showed some late-game moxie by driving
through heavy traffic in the lane and scooping a tying basket off the
glass with a mere 4.2 seconds to play.
It looked for a brief
second like Georgia had pulled off the great escape when Dustin Ware threw up a desperation, long-range 3-pointer with under a second to play, and it went in. But Georgia coach
Mark Fox had called timeout and was granted that timeout prior to Ware
releasing the shot. With .8 seconds to play, Thompkins heaved up an
airball.
Overtime. Bama, which had NIT written all over it just a few minutes earlier, had new life.
In
overtime, the Tide continued to hang close. Finally, with 2:44 left,
Chris Hines scored to give Bama a 59-58 advantage. The Tide's first lead
since being up 9-8 early in the game. Yeah, it had been that long. A
Ware free-throw knotted it back up at 59-59. Then, with 1:32 showing on
the clock, Tony Mitchell seized the moment by stepping up and knocking
down a huge 3-pointer.
It proved to be the game-winner. It also may prove to be the shot
that saved Bama's NCAA Tournament hopes. The Tide went on to win
Saturday, 65-59, and talk now is that that victory -- the Tide's fifth
this season over a foe from the big, bad SEC Eastern Division -- just
may have catapulted Bama, now 21-10, into the Big Dance. ESPN's bracket
guru Joe Lunardi is now projecting Bama as one of the last four teams in
and Georgia, 21-11, as one of the last four teams out.
Whatever it did as far as Bama's NCAA Tourney hopes it certainly
made Anthony Grant's squad look good. Two more wins and Bama won't need a
selection committee to decide its fate. The Tide moves on now to the
SEC Tournament semifinals -- its deepest run in the tourney since '05 --
and will take on Kentucky at noon CT Saturday. The finals are set for noon
Sunday with the NCAA Tournament field scheduled to be announced later Sunday.
And
speaking of fate, don't tell Grant there's no such thing. When asked
after the game about how the game played out in Bama's favor late in
regulation and then in overtime, he replied, "It's fate, I guess."
But this Tide team, characterized by its tenacity, will and fight throughout the second half of the season, did its part, too.
"We
stayed the course," Grant said, referencing the amazing comeback. "Our
energy on the defensive end the last seven minutes of the game was what
won the game for us."
Bama got in the hole -- the one it spent
most of the game in -- late in the first half when Georgia hit
back-to-back-to-back 3-pointers to turn a 19-19 contest into a 28-19
advantage. The Bulldogs remained comfortably ahead -- never letting its
lead dip below six points -- until that game-changing 11-1 run Green
started the Tide on when he hit those two free throws at the 6:43 mark.
Green finished with a team-high 20 points, while Travis Leslie's 24 points paced Georgia.
