keithlaw (http://twitter.com/keithlaw) The Mets will sign him once he has a
career-ending injury. RT @thenamesbrand (http://twitter.com/thenamesbrand) Great, so we
can delay the Hudson/Mets rumors one more year?

For those of you trying to
process how long that Isner-Mahut match lasted, it was the equivalent of
2.1 innings of Steve Trachsel

thechampagneoffans03-19-2011, 05:52 PMGod, Klaw roasting people on the reg makes my twitter feed single-handedly worth reading.
HTF04-02-2011, 06:08 PMkeithlaw Just saw the Dodgers' lineup for today. They know spring training is over, right?
Would it be overkill if we started a thread for just klaw tweets?

In a word, no.

Calling the current Astros' roster "cupcakes" for their opponents would be an insult to cupcakes
Keith really needs his own thread.
HTF07-31-2011, 02:19 PMHere we go. Much deserved.
gobravez07-31-2011, 02:26 PMI posted this one in the trade deadline thread last night, but it needs to be in here too

The Giants, tired of playing a statue (Tejada) or an automatic out (Crawford) at short, acquire Orlando Cabrera, who is both

TEH WINZ!!!?!
Andruw2512-02-2011, 05:57 PMAs much as I respect Keith Law he lost some credibility with his list of top 50 players under 25.
With Hanson at number 40 & Craig K being number 49.
He does say Hanson would be in his top dozen if healthy but dropping him that low is BS considering he has numerous guys ahead of Hanson who have missed time b/c of major surgeries. .
Also having Brandon Belt six spots higher than Freeman is a joke.
I think he was correct with Upton being number 1 but I would of had Kershaw a lot higher.
I also would not have had Minor on the list.
Braves on his list:
12- Heyward
23- Freeman
40- Hanson
46- Beachy
49- Kimbrel
50- Minor
vnodnarb12-02-2011, 06:46 PMHe said the only reason Kershaw wasn't higher was the inherent risk of being a starting pitcher. Hitters are simply safer.
McCarroll2112-02-2011, 07:40 PMSo, wait... a very good writer that understands how to evaluate baseball talent came out with a list of top talent under 25 years old and we have 6 players on the list and people are complaining?
This isn't Mark Bowman or David O'Brien, this is a guy that understands baseball.
mattybz2812-02-2011, 10:16 PMNot one of his twenty posts is any less ridiculous than the previous.
This is why we can't have nice things.

I wasn't trying to complain about the number of Braves on the list just trying to talk about the list overall, sorry I didn't make that clear.
I agree Law is a very good analyst / writer who knows much more about the game than DOB or MB.
We can all agree it is a good sign for now and the future that our club has this much young talent.
