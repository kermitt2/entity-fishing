Rhys is a young fly-half/full-back who signed for the Cornish Pirates in April, 2008, from Premiership side Sale Sharks. He is the son of Kingsley Jones, a former Wales captain and nowadays Director of Rugby at Sale, and his grandfather is Phil Kingsley Jones who has coached, managed and been a mentor to former All Blacks star Jonah Lomu.
Highlights for Rhys include making his Premiership debut for Sale Sharks, playing at full-back in 2007 against Gloucester, and also playing for Wales U19s in their 2006 'Grand Slam' winning side.
A rugby hero is Neil Jenkins, who is described as, "a great role model", and one Rhys has been fortunate to work with at various Welsh age group levels. Whilst on loan from Sale in February, 2008, Rhys also made a debut for Cardiff Blues against Munster.
Arriving in Cornwall, Rhys looked forward to the challenges ahead, him excited and keen to be part of a team that he feels "has the potential to achieve great things."
Rhys played 23 games for the Pirates in his first season in Cornwall, when he was a clear top scorer with 181 points. Also, as a special highlight, he played for the Barbarians (along with Rhodri McAtee) against the Combined Services in the Annual Remembrance Day match.
Early in the summer of 2009, Rhys was further honoured when he was called into the Wales Sevens squad that competed in the final two tournaments of the season's IRB World Sevens Series, playing at both Twickenham and Murrayfield
