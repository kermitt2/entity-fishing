Posted in Child Care
Hi. I have a 2 month old son and I am looking to find child care - preferably nanny share - for him from beginning February. Anyone knows any families that might be interested? or where to look for them? Anyone with suggestions as to where to find a nanny - with good recommendations?
We live on Ashbury street at Waller
Thanks,
Marie

Dear Marie,
Precious Treasures is located on Urbano Drive in Ingleside Terraces – a private residential neighborhood in San Francisco.  We are close to the 280 and 101 freeways, the K and M MUNI lines, and the Balboa Park BART station.  We are available 24/7, but our regular business hours are 7:30A to 6:00P Monday through Friday.  We cater primarily to infants (0-2 years), but children who go through our program are welcome to remain as long as you wish.  You are welcome to park your car in my neighborhood (no stickers or time limits) and take public transportation or carpool.  We have two infant spaces available (one open now and one opening in May of 2012; 0-6 months preferred, but not required), one toddler space available, as well as after-school care, evenings, weekends, and overnights for children of all ages.
I have…
•    Been a professional childcare provider since 1990.  For the first 18 years, I worked as a Governess / Tutor / Mentor for children ages zero through the teenage years throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.  I opened Precious Treasures (my family home childcare) November 2008 so that I could work more integrally with children and their families.  My techniques are based on Montessori and Magda Gerber.  I have experience with multiples, infants with colic and GERD, special needs children, and teens as well.
•    A Bachelors degree in Psychology from Golden Gate University (Magna Cum Laude).
•    12 Early Childhood Education (ECE) units from the California Nanny College (accredited by the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools), certifying me as a Governess, Nanny, and Teacher’s Assistant.
•    Infant, Child, and Adult First Aid, CPR, and AED Certifications as well as California Childcare Preventative Health and Safety Certification (all updated annually).  This course provides training as required by AB243, the California Child Care Law, that requires at least one staff person present in the childcare setting who has 15 hours of CPR, first aid, and safety training.  Topics included are Infant, Child, and Adult CPR, AED, and First Aid, Injury Prevention, and Health in the Childcare Setting.  Upon successful completion of course requirements, students receive the following certifications: Infant, Child, and Adult CPR and AED (valid one year), California Childcare First Aid (valid two years), and California Childcare Preventative Health and Safety (no expiration).
•    Passed a TB test.
•    Passed a fingerprint/background check with the Department of Justice.
•    Attended and will continue to attend various seminars and trade-related classes to continually update all renewable certifications as well as to learn new techniques and keep up-to-date in this field.
•    Accumulated a book of pictures and recommendation letters from present and former families, former teachers, as well as members of the Golden Gate Mothers Group, the US military, and the FBI that I enjoy sharing and expanding with each family.
•    A curriculum that encourages children to explore and discover their world through the use of sensory play (i.e.: water play, climbing equipment, multi-textured toys, etc.) and activity immersion (i.e.: learning by doing to encourage mental, social, emotional, and physical growth).
•    A planned activity outside of my facility each day.  Some of the activities we participate in include the San Francisco Zoo, the California Academy of Sciences, the Randall Museum, local music and dance concerts, and various story and play groups.
•    Associated with the following organizations: Children’s Council of San Francisco
