Here
at Antioch, we are Disciples for Christ, the Church of
Three Ships: Worship, Friendship, and Fellowship; Where our worship is produced by our daily devotion with God,
Where our friendship is produced by our love, Where our
fellowship is produced by our relationship with Christ.
Here at Antioch, we are Kingdom Building.
