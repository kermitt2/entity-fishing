Book Alert / The Infernal Machine -- A History of Terrorism
The Infernal Machine -- A History of Terrorism from the Assassination of Tsar Alexander II to Al-Qaeda, The New Press '07, $26.95, 410 pages, ISBN #978-1-59558-179-2. Index, selected bibliography, notes, unillustrated.
Conventional wisdom has it that international terrorism is biggest enemy of peace today. But when attempting to define terrorism, forget the stereotype of a masked bomber. In Lebanon, for instance, Hezbollah is a recognized political party whose members have been elected to the Lebanese Parliament in a free and open election, yet such world powers as the United States and Britain label it as a terrorist organization.
Carr, a British journalist and broadcaster, ranges back in time to the 1880s to profile the history of terrorism. Included in this narrative sweep are the attack by Russian revolutionaries upon Tsar Alexander II in St. Petersburg, the African vengeance of the Mau Maus, the Palestine Liberation Organization, Basque separatists and Ireland's IRA.
Rather than merely hanging labels around the necks of one's political enemies,  Carr believes it's more useful to examine the root causes of terrorism. "The present eruption of Islamist violence is perhaps a symptom of an imbalance of power," he says, "and the consequence of decades of manipulation, deceit and hypocrisy in Western foreign policy towards the Arab world." This is a work unlikely to show up on George W. Bush's reading list.
