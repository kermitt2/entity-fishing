Finals pain before success
August 22nd 2006 05:29
After seven consecutive wins, the Fremantle Dockers are being talked up as legitimate premiership contenders.
Some commentators of the game are even going as far to suggest that a Dockers flag in 2006 isn't out of the realms of possibility, and while this a romantic notion it isn't necessarily in lines with reality.
History suggests that a side needs to experience finals pain before they can genuinely contend for the premiership.
The Dockers cross-town rivals West Coast fell short at the last hurdle in 1991 against Hawthorn, but bounced back the next season to claim the first of two premierships in three years for the club.
Even Brisbane, regarded by many as the greatest side of the modern era played five finals from 1999 to 2000 before claiming the first of three flags in 2001.
Compare this with Fremantle who have played one final since their inception in 1995- a 44-point loss to Essendon at Subiaco in 2003, and you can see why any talk of
a Docker premiership is premature.
One only has to ask the likes of Port Adelaide, Sydney or St Kilda to find out how hard it is to win a premiership.
Consider this, the Power played seven finals from 2001-03 and were arguably the best side in the competition during the season proper, having collected three straight minor premierships from 2002-04, but didn't snag their first flag until '04.
The Saints would have to join Port as the most unlucky side of the modern era.
The men from Moorabbin haven't tasted premiership success since 1966, and have lost consecutive preliminary finals to the Power and Sydney respectively.
One would suggest that the premiership window has closed on the Saints.
Even last year's premiers have fallen short in recent years prior to their success of 2005.
The Swans lost a preliminary final to eventual premiers Brisbane in 2003, after being right in the match at three-quarter time and seemingly having the Lions on the rope.
Sydney experienced more pain in '04 when they were comprehensively beaten by the Saints to the tune of 61 points in a semi-final.
Would you have predicted the Swans to come out the following season and capture the flag?
Probably not, but it's clear that they were better for the experience.
Experience is the key, something which Fremantle lacks, with only skipper Peter Bell,hard-man Josh Carr, Jarrad Schofield and former Lion Des Headland tasting premiership success
Adding further weight to the lack of experience argument is the fact that the three players in the Fremantle squad to have played the most finals have done so with other clubs, Jarrad Schofield (17) with Port Adelaide, Peter Bell (16) with the Kangaroos and Dockers and Jeff Farmer (7) with Melbourne and Freo.
Thus any talk of a Fremantle premiership is all too premature. Let them win a final first and see where it takes them.
Remember, finals pain before premiership gain.
