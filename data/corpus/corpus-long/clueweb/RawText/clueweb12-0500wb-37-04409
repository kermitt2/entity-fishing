Chester among 22 schools to earn stimulus funding
CHESTER — Chester Academy is among 22 school districts have been awarded grants of approximately $145,000 each from the federal Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (NCLB Title II-D) as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009.
A total of $3.2 million in federal funds has been allocated to New Hampshire schools to develop technology rich learning environments as part of the state's 21st Century Classrooms Initiative.
These classrooms will be well equipped with computer hardware, software, electronic presentation systems, and rich digital and online curricular resources.
Students in these classrooms will be highly engaged in interactive learning and higher level thinking skills, whether learning math,
science, reading, or history. The use of digital cameras, interactive white boards, robust courseware, digital content, computers, and mobile learning tools will provide students with opportunities to collaborate and connect to rich and relevant content. Investment in core components for technology, collaborative planning, enthusiastic and well-informed leadership, intensive professional development, and IT support are some of the key elements necessary to transform these schools into 21st century classrooms.
In addition to Chester, other districts receiving the ARRA funding include: Alton, Bartlett, SAU 6 (including Claremont & Unity), Laconia, Lafayette Regional, Manchester, Milton, Nashua, Oyster River, SAU 53, (including Allenstown, Deerfield, Epsom, Pembroke), Pittsfield, Portsmouth, Profile, Raymond, Somersworth
