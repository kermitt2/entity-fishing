After a National Championship game for the ages, and a Final Four utterly
dominated by Kansas & Memphis, it is no shock that CHN’s All-Final Four team is
all Jayhawks and Tigers.
MOP: Mario Chalmers, Kansas
Final Four Averages: 14.5ppg, 3.5rpg, 3.0apg, 3.5spg
Chalmers truly was Super Mario in the championship game versus Memphis.  By now
the whole world has heard and seen his last second three-pointer to tie the game
in regulation, but he excelled in other aspects of the game also.  Always a
tough defender, he was a thorn in Memphis’ side as they tried to run their
offense and picked off four balls.  Plus Memphis’ ultimate Achilles Heal was
Chalmers strong suit this game – he was 6-6 from the charity stripe.
MOP Runner Up: Darrell Arthur, Kansas
Final Four Averages: 13.0ppg, 9.5rpg, 2.0bpg
Arthur quietly had an excellent championship game also.  He was his usual
exceptional self down low, providing scoring and rebounding (including five on
the offensive end), and also knocked down some face up jumpers.  Plus he didn’t
miss a free throw (2-2).
All Final Four Team:
Guard: Mario Chalmers, Kansas
Guard: Brandon Rush, Kansas
Final Four Averages: 18.5ppg, 6.5rpg, 16/26 FG
Rush scorched UNC to get the Jayhawks into the final.  Against Memphis he had a
very solid 12 points and six boards.  NBA, here he comes (finally).
Guard: Derrick Rose, Memphis
Final Four Averages: 21.5ppg, 7.5rpg, 6.0apg
Rose’s explosive NCAA tournament performance has shown why he, and not Michael Beasley, is the top prospect of this year’s NBA draft.
Guard: Chris Douglas-Roberts, Memphis
Final Four Averages: 25.0ppg, 2.5rpg, 15/20 FT
His inability to hit clutch free throws kept Memphis from winning its first
men’s hoops national championship and also kept Douglas-Roberts from being CHN’s
Final Four MOP.  Pretty sure the first one hurts more than the second.
Forward: Darrell Arthur, Kansas
