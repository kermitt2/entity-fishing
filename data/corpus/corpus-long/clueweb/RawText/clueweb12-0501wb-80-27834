Irn-Bru bus at Borough Briggs
Written by William McKenzie

GET your tinnies oot...the girder bus is on its way!
Further to our article about 'Cans for Youth Teams' (see below), it has been announced the Irn-Bru bus will be at Borough Briggs on Saturday for City's important clash against Queen's Park.
The 'drink it, crush it, score it' scheme - a £70,000 initiative between the Scottish Football League and their sponsors Irn-Bru - will see clubs pick up a share of the pot.
The more cans the fans of a club collect, the bigger the share it will receive.

A LAST-GASP equaliser from substitute Barry Wilson stretched City's unbeaten Irn-Bru Third Division run to six games.
Borough Briggs bogy side Clyde came within a minute of derailing the Black and Whites' charge towards the play-offs by taking the lead against the run of play before the break.
But dogged City again dug deep and Wilson, on the park for less than five minutes, fired home a deserved leveller.
Manager Ross Jack named the same side which started the 3-2 win at Montrose but, despite dictating the early play, it was the visitors who took the lead shortly before the break.
City now entertain an on-song Queen's Park outfit which took over second place with a 1-0 win at Montrose.

Top Gunn secures the points

CITY stretched their impressive winning run to four games as Craig Gunn grabbed a hat-trick to seal a hard-earned 3-2 victory at Montrose.
The Gable Endies made City battle for the spoils on the artificial Links Park surface, but Gunn took his tally for the season to 18 to secure the points.
Despite a worrying array of niggling injuries to several players, manager Ross Jack was forced into just one change to the line-ups which started against Alloa and Clyde.
Mark Durnan, who came off the bench to notch the clincher against the Bully Wee in midweek, retained his place and the buoyant Black and Whites got the boost of another early goal.
But the Angus side twice bounced back with equalisers before Gunn did the trick with the deciding goal in 70 minutes.
The win takes City into fourth spot in the Irn-Bru Third Division table ahead of a run of four straight - and possibly crucial - home games, starting with the visit of Clyde on Tuesday.

City hit back to end away blues
Written by William McKenzie
Tuesday, 21 February 2012 22:58
CITY racked up a third straight Irn-Bru Third Division win as they bounced back from a goal down to notch a superb success against Clyde,
The delayed start at Broadwood due to the late arrival of the bus carrying City's north contingent saw the Black and Whites trailing 1-0 at the interval.
But Ross Jack's side, showing no changes to the starting 11 which helped City to a resounding 3-0 win over league-leaders Alloa on Saturday despite injury and illness doubts, replied with second half counters from Daniel Moore and substitute Mark Durnan.
The three points, only City's second full haul on the road this season, takes them within two points of fourth place Annan and three of third Queen's Park
