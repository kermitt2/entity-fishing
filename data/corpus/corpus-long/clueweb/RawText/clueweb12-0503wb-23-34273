I’ll be using it to catch up with tasks that I’ve neglected, as well as getting prepared for the next year. On Christmas, I’ll be video-conferencing my mom, dad, and brother in the morning, and then I’ll be having a nice and peaceful dinner with friends.Greetings to readers :I’d like to wish all Six Revisions readers a happy holiday and a happy New Year!Steven Snell | Vandelay Design Blog and DesignM.agWebsite : http://vandelaydesign.com and http://designm.ag/How will you spend your Holidays ?I will be spending Christmas at my home. My parents, my wife’s parents and her brothers are coming to our house. Last year we ate and played games most of the day, so I’m thinking this year will be more of the same. I have no plans for new years aside from watching some football (American football that is).Greetings to readers : I hope everyone has a great time with friends and family during the holidays. Try to take plenty of time away from work and enjoy all of the things that you have been blessed with in your life.Chris Spooner | Blog.SpoonGraphicsWebsite : http://www.blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/How will you spend your Holidays ?This Christmas we’re hosting a large family gathering at our house. The conservatory is being converted into a dining room with a 3 metre long table, nicely decorated with all kinds of Christmassy objects and pretty fairy lights surrounding the room. We have 11 people coming over including Laura’s parents, my parents, Laura’s brother, my two sisters and both our Grandparents. Following this is an evening of games for the youngsters and falling to sleep on the sofa for the oldies.New Year wise, we don’t have any plans as yet. It’s tradition for my Auntie to have a gathering, so if things are going ahead this year, that’s likely to be our destination for New Year partying!Greetings to readers :Best Christmas wishes to all CrazyLeaf readers, and a great new year filled with exciting design projects!John Campbell | DesignBumpWebsite : http://designbump.com/How will you spend your Holidays ?I was lucky enough to spend the first half of December soaking up the sun in Jamaica with my beautiful girlfriend. For the second half, I will be visiting family for in Tampa, Florida and relaxing with close friends. Hopefully not too much of my time will be spent on work or thinking about websites.Greetings to readers :I hope everyone has a great, safe, and fun filled Holiday season spent with those you love most!Umut Muhaddisoglu | Web Resources DepotWebsite : http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/How will you spend your Holidays ?I’m trying to launch a web-design-related project that I had in mind for a while. Some days of the holidays will include coding for sure. For the rest, it seems to be a snowboarding vacation very close to where I live or a dream-plan which is going kiteboarding in a warmer country (the plain tickets are currently too high and trying to catch an opportunity). All with my wife and few friends (except coding J).Greetings to readers :Wishing all CrazyLeaf Design Blog readers happiness (and, hopefully, the rest follows).Alen Grakalic | Css GlobeWebsite : http://cssglobe.com/How will you spend your Holidays ?I will spend it with my family. Holidays are usually far less busy than usual so it’s a perfect opportunity to be with people you love. We’ll just spend a lot of time at home with friends coming over.Greetings to readers :May all your wishes come true not by waiting for something nice to happen but by going out there and make it happen!Johnson Koh | 10Steps.SGWebsite : http://10steps.sg/How will you spend your Holidays ?Christmas has become more meaningful now as it is also my wedding anniversary.

However, I’ll also be spending time with my family and girlfriend, and with any luck drinking far too much. The good news is that despite being preoccupied with this dissertation I’m feeling incredibly inspired lately, and so can’t wait to pour my efforts into PSDFAN in the new year!Greetings to readers :I hope that all CrazyLeaf readers have a fantastic holiday, and remember to take time to relax with your loved ones.Naveed Javaid | SmashingAppsWebsite : http://www.smashingapps.com/ How will you spend your Holidays ?
