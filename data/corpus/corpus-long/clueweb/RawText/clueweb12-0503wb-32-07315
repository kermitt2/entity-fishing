Barbara Holliday
Shelley PiaseckaSenior Lecturer
Drama and Theatre Studies
I joined the faculty of Arts and Media in 2011 as a full-time member of Drama and Theatre Studies. Prior to this, I was a senior lecturer at Staffordshire University. I am also an experienced performer in contemporary theatre and combine my teaching with professional practice.
Qualifications
I graduated from MMU (Cheshire) in 2005 with a MA (by Research). I am in the final stages of PhD study, exploring performance pedagogy in the Primary School Curriculum.
Overview My Teaching expertise lies in the interpretation and direction of devised and scripted play texts, interdisciplinary performance practice, Live Art, Post Modern Performance Theory, Theatre Semiotics and play text analysis. For many years I have taken students on residential visits to New York City and performance festivals in the United Kingdom and Europe. I have a research interest in performance theatre, educational drama and performance ethnography.
