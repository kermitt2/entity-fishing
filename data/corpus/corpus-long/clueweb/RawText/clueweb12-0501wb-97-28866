John Stamos Expected to Star in "Bye Bye Birdie"
It looks like John Stamos will play Albert Peterson, the role originated by Dick Van Dyke, in the Roundabout's forthcoming revival of "Bye Bye Birdie." He even revealed to E! News that he will be in the show. 20 years earlier, he would have been a perfect candidate for Conrad. But Albert? Stamos has appeared in two previous Roundabout productions: as a replacement Emcee in "Cabaret" and as a replacement Guido in "Nine."
Broadway by the Year 1931 Review
1931, in the throes of the Great Depression, was a year of transition for Broadway. Not too many musicals were around. And the majority of them are not exactly familiar or revivable. In terms of classics, there was “Of Thee I Sing.” And, to an extent, “The Bandwagon.” That show is never revived, but it inspired a classic film musical. And inside the revues and flops, you will find two all-time American Songbook classics: “As Time Goes By” and “Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries.”
