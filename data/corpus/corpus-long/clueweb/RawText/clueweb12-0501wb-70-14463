Juvenile Rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is a heterogeneous
disease consisting of several clinical subgroups. It is an autoimmune disease
associated with the HLA class II genes. It is negatively associated with
HLA-DR1-DQ5 in Latvians. DR1-DQ5 was also decreased in seronegative patients
compared to seropositive patients in Latvian JRA. In addition to HLA, we
looked for an additional second susceptibility loci for JRA in Major Histocompatibility
Class III region. MICA gene is located in the MHC class III region and
is expressed by monocytes, keratinocytes and endothelial cells. Sequence
determination of MICA gene identifies trinucleotide repeat (GCT) microsatellite
polymorphism, which identifies 5 alleles with 4,5,6 and 9 repetitions of
GCT or 5 repetitions of GCT with 1 additional nucleotide insertion (GGCT).
The alleles are A4, A5, A5.1 , A6 and A9. The aim of our study was to find
the association of MICA alleles with JRA patients (n=119) and healthy controls
(n=108) from Latvia. The samples were analysed for MICA by PCR amplification
and fragment sizes were determined in ABI prism DNA sequencer. HLA-DQ was
genotyped by PCR-SSO.
Allele 4 was significantly increased in patients
(40/119, 34%) compared to controls (19/108, 17%)(OR=2.37, p<0.01, Pc<0.05).
4/5.1 genotype was also significantly increased in JRA patients (22/119,
18%) compared to 7/108 (6%) controls (OR=3.27, p<0.01, Pc<0.05).
5/5.1 genotype was decreased in JRA patients (4/119, 3%) compared to 13/108
(12%) controls (OR=0.25, p<0.01, Pc=ns).
In conclusion, allele A4 of MICA is increased in
JRA patients compared to healthy controls and 4/5.1 genotype also increased
in Latvian patients with JRA. Our findings suggest that MICA may play an
important role in the etiopathogenesis of IDDM
