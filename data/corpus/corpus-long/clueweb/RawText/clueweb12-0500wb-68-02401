Mizrachi the provisional leader after WPT Championship day two
2008-04-22 14:12:21
Robert Mizrachi is the unofficial chip leader at the World Poker Tour (WPT) Championship event in Las Vegas.The exact chip counts have yet to be correlated, but it is thought that he is currently in the number one position with 523,200.Bryan Devonshire is likely second with 393,400, followed by Cory Carroll (384,700), John Celili (377,000) and last year's winner Carlos Mortensen (371,600).The field was cut down to 200 players during day two, which saw perhaps the greatest number of stars eliminated in tournament history.Freddy Deeb, Erick Lindgren and Antonio Esfandiari all got the chop, as did David Pham, Phil Hellmuth and Joe Hachem.Approximately a dozen more major titlists were also knocked out, with many more surviving, including Phil Ivey, Marcel Luske, Gus Hansen and Dave Ulliott.According to Card Player, "day two of the 2008 WPT Championship featured the most impressive field, pound-for-pound, that an open buy-in no-limit hold'em poker tournament has ever seen".
