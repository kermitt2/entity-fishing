A modern, user-friendly, good value and surprisingly powerful
PC Photography package.
Photoshop is so dominant that it has almost come to define its field
- but it's certainly not the right photo editor for every user. To begin
with it's expensive and its high-end power is overkill for the average
home user. More importantly, for this largest market of all, Photoshop
fails to provide any functionality in the most important area of all -
dedicated handling of digital camera images. While Paint Shop Pro (see
page ) tries to match Photoshop's functionality across the board at a
budget price, MGI PhotoSuite has instead chosen to try and fill the gap
by targeting the more focused needs of the home photographer.
It's not just PhotoSuite's intended use that is so different. While Paint Shop Pro slavishly tries to copy the traditional Photoshop-style interface,
PhotoSuite breaks new ground. Running down the left-hand side of the screen
is the Activity panel which provides guided assistance to all commands
and tools, while across the top of the screen is the navigation bar with
buttons for accessing the program's seven main modules - Get, Prepare,
Compose, Organize, Share, Print and Browse. In many ways using the program
is like visiting a well-structured and well thought-through Web site.
This shouldn't be too surprising as PhotoSuite is actually built on an
embedded version of Internet Explorer 5.
The first of the PhotoSuite modules is Get which is used to access your
images from your computer or scanner or digital camera. The number of
cameras PhotoSuite 4 supports directly - Agfa, Epson, Kodak and Olympus
- has been increased, but you should be able to access most models through
the generic TWAIN interface. One limitation, especially compared to Paint Shop Pro's excellent image browser, is that the standard Open dialog can
only show one image preview at a time. MGI has thrown in a simple standalone
Viewer utility to help you quickly identify files but again this is restricted
to showing single images.
This is disappointing, but PhotoSuite makes up for it with its Organize
module. This lets you store multiple image thumbnails in named albums-
ideal for handling all your holiday or product shots for example. It takes
a little work to set up compared to Paint Shop Pro's instant browsing,
but it offers more power. To begin with you can add keywords for searching
and sorting. More importantly, albums can be used as the basis for slideshows,
printing and Web display.
PhotoSuite specializes in dealing with sets of images
- ideal for PC Photography.
Albums also come into their own in the Prepare module as their images
can be displayed in the Library panel down the right hand side of the
screen and dragged and dropped onto the central image window for editing.
The Prepare module is itself split into separate modules, such as Rotate
and Crop, TouchUp and Paint and Draw, to cover all editing tasks. The
level of power on offer isn't quite up to Paint Shop Pro levels, but more
users will feel comfortable with PhotoSuite's simple Brightness/Contrast,
Gamma, Fix Colour and Image Enhance commands than with Paint Shop Pro's
histogram adjustments and technical filters.
In terms of new power the Prepare module sees four main enhancements.
The first is the introduction of the Photo Sprayer tool. This is a pretty
typical image hose used for spraying bitmap objects, such as flowers and
butterflies, onto your image. Again the control on offer is surprisingly
advanced with customisable size, spread and opacity and you can also create
your own nozzles. The second is a reworking of the existing PhotoTapestry
effect. This takes an image and recreates it as a series of tiles based
on the collection of 30,000 supplied thumbnails. Now you can add your
own image to the tile set or create a new set from scratch - though this
is only practical if you have plenty of images and plenty of disk space!
Much the most impressive new feature is the complete overhaul of PhotoSuite's
Stitching capabilities based on PhotoVista technology MGI acquired from
LivePicture. Now you can create seamless panoramas simply by dragging
up to 48 images onto the main image window, roughly positioning them and
then selecting your camera lens type. You can even choose to create 360-degree
immersive panoramas. Generally the process is simple and the results are
impressive and you could easily expect to pay more for less powerful dedicated
stitching software.
The Stitching feature is excellent for building up
panoramas.
The fourth new editing advance is the improvement in what PhotoSuite
calls its "cut-out" handling. Essentially a cut-out is any selection of
the image that you make using the various marquee, magic wand and edge
finder tools and then float above the underlying image. Now cut-outs can
be stored by quickly sending them to the Library or by saving them to
file. You can also now change the edge fading and the overall opacity
of the cut-out to make it seem a more integral part of the underlying
image.
This is undoubtedly a step forward but PhotoSuite definitely
isn't the right program for producing advanced layer-based compositions.
Instead its cut-outs are better seen as object-based props and indeed
PhotoSuite provides a selection of props, such as hats and hair, for producing
photo-based projects in its Compose module. The obvious use is for producing
humorous cards and generally having a bit of fun but, amongst its selection
of over 1200 templates, PhotoSuite also includes some high-resolution
business options for producing calendars, posters, business cards and
so on.
The Compose module offers thousands of photo-based
projects.
Once you've finished preparing your photo or your project, the next step
is to let others see it. The traditional approach to this is catered for
with PhotoSuite's Print module. This offers a print preview in which you
can size and position your image either automatically or interactively.
Alternatively using the enhanced Print Multiple command you can print
multiple copies of the same image on the same page - important when photo-quality
paper is so expensive. As well as generic layouts PhotoSuite now provides
layouts designed for Kodak and Avery stock, but there's still no option
to create your own layout or to print different images on the same page.
Alternatively you can cut out the need for paper completely
with the Share module. This lets you turn albums into slideshows complete
with full control over timings and transitions. You can also add sound
and PhotoSuite 4 now supports MP3. If the person you want to show your
photos to isn't actually present you can use PhotoSuite's e-mail capability.
This lets you send individual or multiple files and lets you automatically
convert images to JPEG with the option of specifying a desired size. You
can even choose to send slideshows complete with an embedded player. Alternatively
for the widest possible access you can post your images to GatherRound.com.
The Share module lets you create advanced slideshows
which can be sent as email.
Web access of this sort is increasingly important and PhotoSuite's Share
module offers two new dedicated Web commands. The first is the Animated GIF command that lets you create and edit simple bitmap-based animations
for inclusion on your Web page. Like the slideshow feature this is based
on a storyline under the main image window where you can drag frames and
set up transitions. This is effective for slideshow-style effects but
useless for others such as motion-based animation. Here you have to edit
individual frames and trying to swap between Share and Prepare modules
soon becomes a major headache.
The second new command lets you output image albums or selected images
as Web pages. This support is based on the use of pre-designed templates
that you can customise to add your own titles, captions and dates. You
can also add or delete any object on the page, which is just as well as
the default designs are pretty awful with horrendous backgrounds and distracting
animated GIFs. Once you've customised a template, however, the end results
are generally impressive though I would have preferred some simpler templates
based on a thumbnail index and full-size image pages rather than the combined
slideshow pages.
Web templates can be customised - which is just as
well.
All told PhotoSuite's Web capabilities are a mixed bag with advanced
features in some areas and surprising weaknesses in others. In particular
the omission of any serious JPEG and GIF optimisation control is bizarre
- why would you want to produce animated GIFs but not ordinary optimised
GIFs? Hopefully PhotoSuite 5 will include a dedicated Save for Web dialog
with in-built preview and advanced JPEG and GIF control. In the meantime
budget users for whom Web imaging is important might well want to hold
off to see what the imminent release of the Web-oriented PhotoImpact 6
offers.
PhotoSuite's mixed Web-imaging capabilities are particularly strange
as otherwise the program has completely embraced the Net. In particular
PhotoSuite's final module, Browse, takes advantage of its underlying browser-based
architecture to let you surf the Net from within the application! This
lets you drag and drop images directly from the Web onto your library
- copyright permitting. Via the dedicated PhotoSuite web site you can
also access extra content, new project templates, additional filters,
online tutorials and so on - all of which become a seamless part of the
existing program.
This is impressive stuff and MGI is leading the way when it comes to
merging computer and Web, application and content. There is a downside
to PhotoSuite's browser-based approach, however, in that the program can
sometimes seem unresponsive and really requires a speedy system to feel
comfortable. Other possible reasons for looking elsewhere include the
lack of advanced features such as vector, channel and layer-based editing.
It's certainly true that you get more all-round power with a traditional
application like Paint Shop Pro
