Community Projection Review: Xavier Nady

ZiPS
ACTUAL
Xavier Nady
RF
.281/.338/.452
.280/.340/.467
.278/.330/.476
How about that? We were too pessimistic - perhaps we were too concerned about Nady's power-free showing with the Bucs in 2006 - but ZiPS pretty much nailed it. Escroll came the closest, guessing that Nady would hit .285/.351/.476 if we wasn't platooned (which he wasn't).Speaking of platooning, much has been made of the fact that Nady hit pretty well against right-handed pitching this year, going .274/.322/.479. One problem, though, was that he hit about the same against left-handed pitching and, against lefties, was significantly worse than his career averages. That's a shame because Nady could form a heck of a platoon with Ryan Doumit if Nady went back to his lefty-killing ways and Doumit stayed healthy.In truth, Nady's splits this year probably don't mean a whole lot. He probably will go back to hitting lefties better than righties. And let's hope he does, because consistency shouldn't be high on the list of things we want from Nady. His 105 OPS+ this year is only a notch above average for a rightfielder, he's not a great defender, and he probably won't stay healthy. (The concussion and digestive problems he suffered this year probably won't bother him again, but his hamstring could continue to be an issue.)Nady's useful, but he's a role player, not a star. From a player like that, you should hope for huge platoon splits, because that's an inconsistency that's exploitable. If Nady puts up a 1.000 OPS against lefties and a .750 OPS against righties, and Doumit puts up an .865 OPS against righties like he did last year, then the Pirates have one of the best offensive right-field tandems in baseball even if Doumit is hurt half the time like usual. As it stands now, they're just a little above average.

Speaking of ZiPS...
...the 2008 numbers for us are up.
Bouncebacks for Bay, LaRoche, Duke, and Torres, plus improvement for Doumit, but also dropoffs from Freddy, Nady, and Snell.

Oh, and a big decline from Jack.
As if anyone couldn't have predicted that.

Platoon splits
For RHBs, platoon splits all converge toward the same ratio with additional playing time. This sounds crazy, but it's actually pretty well documented. Lefties and switch-hitters don't do so, for reasons that remain largely speculative.
As such, Nady's platoon splits over the next few years shouldn't be too tough to model.

Vlad,
Have you ever seen an explanation for the platoon advantage? Does it have to do with seeing the ball better from one side or another? That seems kind of counterintuitive to me, because it seems like a RH batter would get a better view of the ball from a pitcher's right hand. Does it have to do with ball movement, pitches from RHPs generally moving away from right-handed batters and vice versa? I'm not debating that the platoon edge exist, it certainly does. But I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to explain why.

Nothing analytical.
If you wanted to break it down, there might be a way to screen any "picking up the ball effect" from a "ball movement" effect. Actually, there are two potential ball movement effects: The one from the location of a release point on one side of the mound or the other, and the one from the direction of motion on breaking balls (since basically nobody throws a screwball nowadays).
The easiest way to do things might be to chart pitches for a low-level kids' league and see whether guys there still have a platoon split. If they do, it's ball movement from release point, since LL kids don't have much deception or any breaking ball. To screen for the breaking ball effect, you could maybe pull a sample of notable screwball pitchers, match them up with non-screwball equivalents who throw from the same side, and see whether there's a difference in platoon split.It's an interesting question.

That seems kinda complicated
Could take years of charting low-level kids games, and I don't have any kids. Could lead to "Billy, whose dad is that creepy old guy sitting over there with the video camera and all the notebooks? Nobody's? Ummm ... Billy, I want you to take the cell and go sit in the car and lock the doors and call 911. NOW, Billy! ... F'in' pervert ..."
So OK, who threw the screwball? Carl Hubbell, I think Mike Cuellar ...

This might be oversimplifying
What Vlad writes below may be true, at least in part, but I think there's a pretty simple explanation:  the caveman instinct of fight or flight.  Mostly flight.
A pitch from a righty to a righty or lefty to lefty, looks to the batter like it will hit him in the head.  It's why guys get their knees buckled, or bail out.  Think Randy Johnson vs. Kruk or Larry Walker.  Yes, he did throw over their heads, but the reason it works is because almost ANY pitch he throws will appear that way at release.  Johnson is an extreme example because he was very tall and his motion wasn't anywhere near over the top.  To lefties, his pitches have to cross their body, so to speak, before reaching the plate.  Even if a batter doesn't conciously think about getting hit, it's a natural self-defense mechanism to shy from a 95mph pitch.  Even if you can't see the batter bail out or flinch, there is something inside the human body that is freezing it.  It's something that separates the good from the great, the ability to fight that natural mechancism.  If you've ever wondered why so-and-so let a fastball go right down the middle for strike three, sometimes this is the reason.

Except I would think
most guys got to the majors by being able to overcome that (although, yes, we still see the bucket-steppers like Paulino).
Dammit, I had what I thought was a novel idea about this, and now I've forgotten what it was. I'm at the age where I have to write everything down ... I'll be back if it comes to me.

While I'm trying
to remember what I forgot, it seems to me azibuck's theory would be fairly easy to gather evidence for (not for me, I don't have anything like the software needed, but maybe one of you does?). Let's say intimidation/fear was a big part of it. It should be a simple matter of splitting pitchers into two or three groups: high-strikeout, medium strikeout and low-strikeout (presumably, hard, fearsome throwers, medium throwers and soft tossers).
The aforementioned Randy Johnson DOES have a large platoon split in his career: vs. RHB: .221/.299/.354; vs. LHB: .195/.277/.286.That doesn't really hold up for some other high-strikeout intimidators tho.Rogers Clemens vs. RHB: .228/.284/.352; vs. LHB: .229/.304/.332.Nolan Ryan vs. RHB: .204/.301/.605; vs. LHB: .203/.314/.606.Meanwhile, a more finesse guy (Greg Maddux) puts up this: vs. RHB: .245/.277/.350; vs. LHB .254/.304/.363.It's a start. Make of it what you will.

Nady/Doumit Platoon is a Good Idea
I agree that platooning these two is good idea. We are short on outfielders that can hit so why not make one better than average one out of two less than average ones?
It worked in 1979 with Milner/Robinson who did not field well but combined to a make a power hitting combination. They combined for 40 HRs and 135 RBIs. Though some of Milner's time was at 1st Base replacing Willie.Also, I don't see either guy complaining too much plus they both can hit off the bench. One drawback is they both don't field real well. But the Pirates need hitters right now.

I still think...
...that not using Doumit behind the plate is a huge waste.
That said, if they've given up on him there, and if they hang onto Nady this offseason, a platoon with Nady wouldn't be a bad idea.

Yeah...
I'd still like to see Doumit catch. Given the new front office, it might actually happen. I guess I'd just taken Paulino's continued presence behind the plate as a given, but there's no reason to do that anymore.
You could also platoon Paulino and Doumit. That might be even more helpful than Nady/Doumit platoon.
