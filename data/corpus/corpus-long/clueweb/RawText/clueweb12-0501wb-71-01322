The whole day just never felt right.
The gloomy weather, a fine mist covering the tail-Gators before the game. The huge gaps of empty seats in the stands, not unpredictable but still embarrassing. The O'Connell Center parking lot looking a lot like it does on a typical Saturday … in July.And then Florida getting boat-raced for a quarter by a team that lost to Elon last week.A text I received from my wife said it all, “Is this really happening?”
Yes, it was and because Florida didn't panic and made adjustments and because Furman doesn't have a player Florida would even invite to Friday Night Lights, the Gators prevailed. Across the country, fans saw the 54-32 final and may have no idea how unsettling it was at The Swamp at around 2:15 p.m. Saturday.Could they possibly lose to Furman?At the time, it looked very possible. At the time, you wondered if the Gator defense would make Furman punt the entire game. At the time, you wondered if anything else could go wrong.“You start to realize that if anything could go wrong, it already has,” Will Muschamp said.Don't look for me to put a positive spin on this game.Sure, the Gators won by three touchdowns.Sure, Florida is bowl eligible.And yes, the Gators will get extra practices leading up to what is almost definitely a Gator Bowl appearance Jan. 2.“It's an extra spring practice,” Muschamp said.Great. More practices we can't watch.But this win said as much about this season as the losses have.Because it was Furman.I know the Paladins came in here fired up for a chance to play in The Swamp. I know they changed their offense during the week and surprised the Gators.But that only accounts for the 67 yards (all on running plays) on Furman's first drive. What about the other 379?“Once we identified what they were doing, we played better,” Muschamp said.After that first drive, Furman had 17 first downs and averaged 5.8 yards per play. That is not a good defense. If you saw it, you don't need the raw numbers to know how this defense didn't show up to play. The Gators missed enough tackles to fill a lowlight tape and so many times Furman running backs moved the pile as if they were being tackled by Pop Warner defenders.That's how it got to be 22-7 Furman after the first quarter. That's how that noise you heard if you had your windows open was the Gator fans who did show up squirming in their seats. That's how it was still a game early in the fourth quarter and I uttered a phrase I never thought I would in the fourth quarter of the Furman game -- “That was a huge field goal by Caleb Sturgis.”In the end, Florida won because it did the two things it hasn't done during the rest of the season.1. The wide receivers were a factor. They caught seven passes for 250 yards and three touchdowns. There was even a Quinton Dunbar sighting. The phenom of the preseason had a couple of big catches, including a touchdown reception.2. They had two pick-sixes. We had forgotten what those looked like. But the Gators iced the game with two nice plays from Pop Saunders and Jelani Jenkins, who had made a habit of dropping interceptions this season. “I had visions of when I was in high school playing running back,” Jenkins said of his 75-yard touchdown sprint.I heard a few boos Saturday when Florida fell behind by two touchdowns thanks in part to another snap over the head of quarterback John Brantley. There were more silly penalties, one on Matt Elam that set up Furman at the Florida 49 on the opening kickoff of the second half. There was the requisite 1-yard loss on a completed pass on third-and-7.And the offensive line continued to shuffle because of injuries, one of the reasons it was unable to open running lanes against a 6-5 FCS team.For much of the season, Gator fans have lamented that their team was just a few plays away from having a respectable record. This game made you wonder how they were competitive with Auburn, Georgia and South Carolina.Saturday was important for these Gators to become bowl eligible. But I'm not sure it showed that these Gators
