The Seventh Alabama Cavalry
The Seventh Alabama Cavalry
The Seventh cavalry was organized in July, 1863, as part of Clanton's
brigade, and served for more than a year in Quarles', Clanton's, Page's,
Patton's and Thomas' brigades, in the vicinity of Pensacola and the bay forts.
In the fall of 1864, it reported to General Forrest at Corinth, and took part in
the raid on Johnsonville and the fighting as Hood moved toward Nashville. It
suffered severely at this time, especially in the night attack on Brentwood. The
regiment, after recruiting, joined General Buford at Montevallo in March, 1865;
confronted Wilson's corps from Benton to Girard, and took part in the last
fighting of the war, surrendering at Gainesville, May 14, 1865. Col. Joseph
Hodgson led the regiment throughout the war, though detachments were at various
times commanded with brilliant success by Maj. Turner Clanton, Jr., Captain
Ledyard, and others. Capt. Charles P. Storrs was wounded at Columbia; Adjt.
William T. Charles was captured at one time, but escaped. Colonel Hodgson, after
the close of the war, devoted himself to journalism, in which he became quite
distinguished, and he was at one time State superintendent of education.
