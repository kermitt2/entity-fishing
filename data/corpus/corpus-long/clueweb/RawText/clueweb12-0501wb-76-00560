Live From the Creation Museum! Dinosaurs on the Ark!
Written by Robert F. Smith aka Seeker4
Wednesday, 11 March 2009 11:35The dichotomy of how many Americans view science was brought home to me rather vividly the other day in two television shows on the same evening. A Nova program on PBS called The Four Winged Dinosaur was a fascinating look at how science works. It was a documentary about the investigation of flightless birds, in particular the archaeopteryx. That same evening, on the NRB Network, there was a Creation Ministries International program on Dinosaurs and the Bible. 12345 Read more... Add new comment Hits: 2463
Manipulative Techniques the Watchtower Uses to Control its Members
Written by Matt Konig
Thursday, 20 May 2010 12:12 1. IsolationThere is a large amount of intentional and incidental isolation that happens when you are a JW.The advice that bad associations spoil useful gifts is one that is repeated continually.Now, the difficult part is that each and every Jehovah's Witness is brought up in a slightly different way. There is a certain amount of personal interpretation allowed, and there are also cultural differences between different countries.I can only speak for my own experience, and those of the people I knew personally. I grew up in a small town in Australia, and in my early years I doubt I mixed with barely any non-Jehovah’s Witness children, and when I was at school the time I was not at school I primarily spent time with other Jehovah’s Witness children. My Jehovah's Witness friends at the time are some of the most amazing and genuine people I have ever met. 12345 Read more... Comments (4) Hits: 1257
What Is 'Evil'?
Written by Lee Marsh
Sunday, 26 February 2012 21:28 Over the past week I have talked to various people about events in my family. The word “evil” keeps getting thrown around to describe my mother. I am always surprised by it. I don’t generally think of people in terms of their actions being evil. So it never occurred to me that maybe my mother’s actions, or inactions, were evil.Generally when I am faced with a question I turn to the books. I do research. So my research this week involved the nature of evil. What it evil? How would I recognize it when and if I saw it? So my first stop is to get the definition of evil. 12345 Read more...

Ridiculous Beliefs Jehovah’s Witnesses Take for Granted
Written by Matt Konig
Thursday, 08 July 2010 18:31 Many of the things written about the JW religion are to expose the flaws in the organization policy. It doesn’t take much digging to uncover a large amount of lies, hypocrisy, ridiculous former beliefs, sweeping things under the carpet, arrogance, and a North Korea approach to running the religion, and playing some pretty serious hardball with anyone who doesn’t play by the rules.Plus a corporate culture where you are rewarded for being obedient, loyal and not shaking up the status quo. Like a sales organization where you are selling a faulty product, initially members seem to buy into the idea, sell it passionately, but after a while you begin to see the flaws in it, and ultimately realize that you have a dud. 12345 Read more...

Jehovah's Witnesses "Watchtower Religion" Impacted My Family History - Part 1
Written by Barbara Anderson
Thursday, 29 January 2009 16:12In 1998, I completely severed my association with Jehovah's Witnesses. However, it wasn't until 2004 that I heard the details from my mother, two years before her death at age 91, of how the Watch Tower organization’s teachings significantly altered her Polish Catholic father's life-course causing him to end up an excommunicated Catholic in Poland although he never became a Watch Tower follower. 12345 Read more...

Jehovah's Witness Literature: Loaded Language & Logical Fallacies
Written by Robert F. Smith aka Seeker4
Saturday, 31 January 2009 11:01The April 15, 2009 Watchtower, according to sources I trust, contains the following lines with regard to what Jehovah’s Witnesses (JWs) refer to as apostates, that is, any former Witness who now speaks openly questioning the Watchtower Society (WTS), the Bible or the Witnesses:"Modern day apostates display characteristics similar to those of the Devil. Their mind may be poisoned by a critical attitude towards individuals in the congregations, Christian elders or the Governing Body. Some apostates oppose the use of the divine name, Jehovah. They are not interested in learning about Jehovah, or in serving him. Like their father, Satan, apostates target people of integrity." Watchtower, April 15, 2009
