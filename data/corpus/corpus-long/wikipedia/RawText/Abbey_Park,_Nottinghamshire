Abbey Park in  is a housing estate that was constructed in the mid– to late–70s by Costain Homes on land that were previously uncultivated fields and allotments. The Willow Tree  was constructed at the same time. All the roads are named after famous abbeys and are laid out in a tight, twisty manner that precludes fast driving.

The estate is divided in two, with the majority of homes being constructed for private purchase, while a smaller number were constructed for council tenants.

There is a mix of three-, four- and five-bedroom homes on the private‐owned estate in townhouse, semi-detached, link detached, and detached configurations, with a small number of bungalows. This part of Abbey Park consists of Bisham Drive, Dale Close, Newstead Drive,  Drive, Fountains Close,  Close, and  Drive. The houses are all arranged in cul-de-sacs. The two through-roads on the estate are Rufford Way and Buckfast Way.

The council-funded area consists of Tewkesbury Close, Hexham Close, Bolton Close, and Furness Close, and includes some warden-aided accommodation for the elderly.

Abbey Park is regarded as a pleasant and quiet area of West Bridgford, and house prices
