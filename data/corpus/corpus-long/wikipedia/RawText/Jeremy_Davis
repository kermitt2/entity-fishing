Jeremy Davis is an American bassist for the band Paramore. In 2002, at the age of 16, he was living in Franklin, Tennessee, where he played in a funk cover band called The Factory where he met Hayley Williams. Through Williams, Davis met the other members, brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro. In 2005, John Janick, founder of record label Fueled by Ramen, signed a contract with them.

Davis also stated that his favorite bands are Deftones, Death Cab for Cutie, Thrice, Sigur RÃ³s, Paper Route and Mew. On September 30, 2011, he married British actress Kathryn Camsey.

Paramore was created in Franklin, Tennessee in 2004 by the two brothers Josh Farro (lead guitar/) and Zac Farro (). Taylor York was also a part of the band from the very beginning, but his parents wanted him to finish school first. Later, they asked Hayley Williams (/keyboards) to join the band, and, through Hayley, Jeremy Davis (bass guitar) joined as well. Prior to forming Paramore, the other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been "edgy about the whole female thing" of having Williams as singer, but as they were good friends she began writing with them and eventually became a member. The band was eventually signed to a deal on Fueled by Ramen. However, before they began recording, Davis left the band for unknown reasons. The song All We Know is about this. For this time, Davis was replaced by John Hembree. The band released their first album, All We Know Is Falling, and one EP, The Summer Tic, without him. However, he rejoined soon afterwards and was present on the band's second album, Riot!. Davis also plays bass on the live albums The Final Riot! and Live in the UK. The band's third album, Brand New Eyes, was released on September 29, 2009. Their fourth album, Paramore (album)
