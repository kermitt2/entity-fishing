State Highway 110 or SH 110 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas that runs from Grand Saline to Rusk.

SH 110 begins at an intersection with  and  in downtown Rusk and leaves the courthouse square north with US 84, crossing  on its way to a split on the northeast side of Rusk where US 84 goes off east and SH 110 turns north, out of town.  The road passes Ponta and New Summerfield before crossing the county line into Smith County as it enters Troup.  After a brief downtown multiplex with SH 135, SH 110 leaves Troup going northwest through Whitehouse on its way to Tyler.  SH 110 swings around the downtown area to the south and west by way of multiplexes with SH 64, SH 155, and US 69.  After splitting with US 69, SH 110 leaves Tyler toward the northwest.  After several miles, SH 110 crosses I-20 south of Garden Valley.  Just after Garden Valley, the road multiplexes with FM 16 and goes west into Van Zandt County.  SH 110 splits with FM 16 in Van and turns back north.  Approaching Grand Saline, SH 110 merges with FM 17 and travels the remaining several blocks multiplexed until it reaches US 80, the northern terminus of SH 110.

SH 110 was originally numbered in 1926 on a route from SH 26 north of Nacogdoches northwest to Sacul.  This was a renumbering of a former portion of SH 40, which was rerouted southward from  in the 1926 plans.  By 1933, the route had been extended to include a route from Rusk northward to Tyler, along with its original route and a planned connection at New Summerfield.  By 1936, the original portion had been renumbered as SH 206, leaving the routing from Rusk to Tyler, and an extension northwest to Grand Saline, completing its current routing.  A section northward to Alba was added in 1940, but was transferred to FM 17
