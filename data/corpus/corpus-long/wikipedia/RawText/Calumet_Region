It is part of the Great Lakes Basin, which eventually reaches the Atlantic Ocean.

Because it was initially cut off from the rest of the state due to natural geographic barriers like the Kankakee Marsh to the south, the Calumet Region was the last-settled portion of Indiana. It is a sub-region of the greater Northwest Indiana region and the even larger Great Lakes region.
