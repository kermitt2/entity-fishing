The discography of Bastille, a British alternative rock band, consists of one studio album, two extended plays, six singles and five music videos. Originally a solo project by Dan Smith, Bastille was formed in 2010. The band released its debut single "Flaws" / "Icarus" in July 2011 on the independent record label Young and Lost Club. An extended play titled Laura Palmer followed later that year. The critical success of the EP and extensive touring brought the group to the attention of Virgin Records, which signed them in December 2011.

Bastille released their debut studio album Bad Blood in March 2013. The album reached number one on the United Kingdom albums chart and the top ten of the Irish albums chart. In March 2013, it was  silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Five singles were released from the album: "Overjoyed", "Bad Blood", "Flaws", "Pompeii" and "Laura Palmer", with "Pompeii" peaking at number one in Ireland and Scotland, and number two in the UK
