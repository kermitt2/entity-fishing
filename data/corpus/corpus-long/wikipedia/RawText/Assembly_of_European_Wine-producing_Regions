The Assembly of European Wine-producing Regions or Assemblée des Régions Européennes Viticoles (AREV) is an organisation of political and trade representatives of wine regions within the European Union (EU) and Eastern Europe. It lobbies the EU on matters affecting its members, and acts as a forum for discussion of policy and marketing.

The European Wine Regions Conference (CERV) was created on 20 June 1988 under Alsatian law. It became the Assembly of European Wine Regions (AREV) in 1994. It is financed by membership subscriptions, and is based in Bordeaux with an office in Strasbourg. The industry representatives are grouped together in the European Wine Trade Council (CEPV), which drafts documents to be approved by the plenary council.
