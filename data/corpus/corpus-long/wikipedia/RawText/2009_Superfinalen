The 2009 Superfinalen was the first edition of Superfinalen, an annual football match contested by the winners of the previous season's Tippeligaen and Norwegian Cup competitions. It was played on 8 March 2009, at Telenor Arena in Bærum, between Stabæk and Vålerenga, winners of the  and 2008 Norwegian Football Cup respectively. A collaboration between the Football Association of Norway, Norsk Toppfotball, the incumbent league and cup champions, and the broadcaster TV 2, the match was seen as a test of the viability of a  in Norway. Modeled on the FA Community Shield, the Superfinalen is intended to be a season opener, with the net proceeds of each match going to charity. In 2009, these proceeds were donated to UNICEF.

The game was a repeat of the 2008 Norwegian Football Cup Final, in which Vålerenga had defeated Stabæk 4&ndash;1. This time, however, it was Stabæk who won the match 3&ndash;1 after goals by Daniel Nannskog, Daigo Kobayashi and Pálmi Rafn Pálmason. Mohammed Abdellaoue scored for the losing side.

The game also served as the official opening match of Telenor Arena
