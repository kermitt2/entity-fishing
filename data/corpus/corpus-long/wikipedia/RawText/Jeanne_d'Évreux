Jeanne d'Évreux (1310 – 4 March 1371) was the third wife of King Charles IV of France, daughter of his uncle  and Margaret of Artois. She bore no male heir, thus "causing" the end of the direct line of the Capetian dynasty. Because she was his first cousin, the couple required papal permission to marry from Pope John XXII.  Jeanne bore Charles three daughters, Jeanne, Marie and Blanche.

Two of Jeanne's remarkable possessions survive—her  and a statue of the Virgin and Child. The Book of Hours, known as the  Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, is in The Cloisters collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It was commissioned from the artist Jean Pucelle between 1324 and 1328, probably as a gift from her husband Charles IV.  The book contains the usual prayers of the Canonical hours as arranged for the laity along with the notable inclusion of the office dedicated to St Louis, her great-grandfather.  The small statue of the Virgin and Child ( and enamel, 69&nbsp;cm high), which Jeanne left to the monastery of  outside Paris, is in the .

Jeanne d'Évreux died on 4 March 1371 in her château at Brie-Comte-Robert, in the  region, some twenty miles south-east of Paris.  She was buried at the Basilica of St Denis
