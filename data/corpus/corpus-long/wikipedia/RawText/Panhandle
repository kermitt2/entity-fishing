A panhandle is an American informal geographic term for an elongated arm-like protrusion of a geo-political entity, such as a  or a sovereign state.

The term "panhandle" derives from the analogous part of a , and its use is generally confined to the United States.  A term used elsewhere is salient, derived from . While similar to a peninsula in shape, a panhandle is not surrounded by water on three sides and connected to a geographical mainland. Instead, it is delimited by a land border on at least two sides and extends out from the larger geographical body of the administrative unit.

The panhandle shape is the result of arbitrarily drawn international or  boundaries, although the location of some administrative borders takes into account other considerations such as economic ties or topography. In the United States, a protrusion with a less elongated shape is informally called a bootheel.

â€  This definition of the Florida panhandle includes the following counties: Bay, Calhoun, Escambia, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Taylor, Wakulla, Walton, and Washington.

Outside the United States, the term is not in common usage, with the arguable exception of the nearby New Brunswick Panhandle
