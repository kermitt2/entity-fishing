Human image synthesis can be applied to make believable and even  renditions of  humans, moving or still.

A synthesized human image is constructed by first sampling the target by means of  and photography and creating a 3D  based on the samples, applying statistical information and approximations.  Synthesis with an actor and suitable algorithms is applied using powerful computers.  The actor's part in the synthesis is to take care of mimicking human expressions in still picture synthesizing and also human movement in  synthesizing. Algorithms are needed to simulate laws of physics and physiology and to map the model and its appearance and movements accordingly.

Many films using  have featured synthetic images of humans or human-like characters.  The  bonus DVD documents and depicts the process in some detail and the techniques used, including facial and limbal motion capture
