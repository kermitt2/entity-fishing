The asteroid 4769 Castalia ( ; previously known by the  1989 PB) was the first asteroid to be modeled by radar imaging. It is an ,  and . It was discovered on August 9, 1989, by Eleanor F. Helin () on photographic plates taken at Palomar Observatory. It is named after Castalia, a nymph in Greek mythology.

On 25 August 1989 Castalia passed  (within eleven lunar distances) of Earth, allowing it to be observed with radar from the Arecibo Observatory by Scott Hudson (Washington State University) and Steven J. Ostro (JPL). The data allowed Hudson et al. to produce a three-dimensional model of the object. During the 1989 passage Castalia peaked at an apparent magnitude of 12.

Castalia has a peanut shape, suggesting two approximately 800-meter-diameter pieces held together by their weak mutual gravity. Since then radar observations of other asteroids have found other contact binaries
