The "Hong Kong Family Welfare Society" was formally known as the Social Service Centre of the Churches. It was founded in 1938, but only became a public agency on January 1, 1949. The Society started out by being heavily involved with relief work after World War II. After concerns for the growth of distressed families resonated with the members, the Society further expanded its scope. Today the bulk of their work revolves around counselling families with management difficulties or communication issues.

Other services like Home Help, School Social Work services, Clinical Psychological services and Foster Care came about in 1971, 1979 and 1984 respectively.
