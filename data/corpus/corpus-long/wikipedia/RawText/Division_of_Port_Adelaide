The Division of Port Adelaide is an Australian electoral division in the state of South Australia. It is located in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, covering the area around the Barker Inlet, part of the Gulf St Vincent. It stretches from St Kilda in the north down to , and is roughly bounded on the east by the Gawler Central railway line. It includes the suburbs of Findon, Woodville, Hendon, Croydon, Exeter, North Haven, Wingfield, Salisbury, Buckland Park, St Kilda and Port Adelaide itself.

The Division was named after the suburb of Port Adelaide, the working port of Adelaide. It was proclaimed at the redistribution of 11 May 1949, and was first contested at the 1949 federal election. The seat is currently a very safe Australian Labor Party seat with the closest the ALP has ever come to losing it was at the 1988 by-election, where Labor candidate Rod Sawford received 55.2 percent of the two-party vote. It currently stands, after the 2010 vote, at 70.03 percent, making it the safest Labor seat in the state and the sixth-safest Labor seat in Australia, with a 20 percent swing required for the Liberals to win it. Port Adelaide remains the only electorate in South Australia to have voted Labor at every federal election in its existence.

A notable curiosity in recent years was that in the 1998 and 2001 federal elections, the seat was the only one in Australia where a Communist Party candidate, Michael Perth, stood for election. This was the only occasion when the Liberal Party did not preference the One Nation Party last. He achieved less than 1 percent of the vote on each occasion.

Sawford retired at the 2007 election, which saw South Australian Labor's historically safe seat easily won by the newly endorsed Labor candidate, unionist and former head of the Left state Labor faction Mark Butler
