Leverett later became interested in klezmer, a traditional musical style of the Jews of Eastern Europe.  She studied with klezmer clarinettist Sidney Beckerman and was a founding member of The Klezmatics in 1985.

In 1999, Leverett was a founding member of another klezmer band called .  This band is named after the mikveh, a traditional ritual bath in which Orthodox Jewish women immerse themselves.  They released a self-titled album in 2001, described by Rambles magazine as "a potent and heady mix of passion and power."  Mikveh calls itself a band whose music "reflects the experience of Jewish women," drawing on Yiddish song and klezmer instrumentation to produce a mixture of older pieces, newer adaptations of historical material, and original compositions.
