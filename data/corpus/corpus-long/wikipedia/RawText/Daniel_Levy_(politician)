Sir Daniel Levy (30 November 1872 &ndash; 30 May 1937) was an Australian politician.

He was born in London to tailor Joseph Levy and Esther, n√©e Cohen. He arrived in Sydney in 1880 and attended Crown Street Superior School, Sydney Grammar School and the University of Sydney, graduating with a first in Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in 1893 and a  in 1895, in which year he was called to the Bar. In 1902 he was admitted as a solicitor. He entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1901 as the Liberal member for Sydney-Fitzroy, transferring to Darlinghurst in 1904 (he would represent Sydney for the period of proportional representation from 1920 to 1927, Paddington from 1927 to 1930, and Woollahra thereafter).

In 1919, Levy, despite being a Nationalist, accepted the position of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from James Dooley's Labor government, provoking discontent within his own party. He resigned with the fall of the government in 1920, was re-appointed by George Fuller for his seven hours as premier, and continued the position when Dooley resumed the premiership later the same day. Becoming known as a scrupulously independent Speaker, Levy advocated the British model of Speakership in which the Speaker's seat was uncontested, and made efforts to have this practice adopted by statute. He was Speaker until 1925, served again from 1927 to 1930, and served briefly in Bertram Stevens' 1932 emergency cabinet as Minister for Justice and Attorney-General. Resuming the Speakership in 1932, he held the position until his death in 1937 at Darling Point
