Harry Steven "Mental Case" Durbano (December 12, 1951 in Toronto, Ontario – November 10, 2002 in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories) was a professional ice hockey player noted for his villainous behavior on the ice and his larger-than-life persona off it.

He moved to the Northwest Territories late in life in an effort to find peace, but died there of liver cancer
