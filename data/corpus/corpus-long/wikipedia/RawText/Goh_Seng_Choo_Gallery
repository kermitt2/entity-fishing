The Goh Seng Choo Gallery is located within the National Museum of Singapore. The gallery hosts the collection of William Farquhar`s natural history drawings. The gallery is named after the museum's chairman, Mr G.K. Goh's late father Mr Goh Seng Choo in his honor. The collection comprises 477 paintings in total, 70 in the main gallery whereas the rest are displayed in the Founding of Singapore section of the Singapore History Gallery. This is due to space constraint as many of the paintings occupy the galleries.

Prior to his tenure as Singaporeâ€™s first Resident and Commandant, William Farquhar served as Resident and Commandant of Melaka from 1803 to 1818. During this period, he made several important botanical and zoological discoveries, and amassed a sizable collection of natural history drawings. Painted by unidentified Chinese artists, Farquhar had commissioned these  which depict the diverse flora and fauna of the Malay Peninsula to the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. These 477 drawings have since found their way back to Singapore through Mr G.K. Goh, who purchased the paintings at a Sotheby's auction held in London for $3 millon. The complete set was donated to the National Museum of Singapore
