Thomas Land is a themed area at Drayton Manor Theme Park in Staffordshire, England, based on the TV series . It stands on the former site of Robinsons Land, a themed area sponsored by the soft drinks brand of the same name. The construction began while the park was still open in September 2007, and many of the Robinsons Land rides were moved to other areas of the park for the remainder of the season. All but the Veteran Cars (now Sodor's Classic Cars) were removed and sold to Funland at Hayling Island. Thomas Land officially opened to the public on 15 March 2008.

Narrow gauge models of Thomas, Percy and  are used on a miniature railway that takes visitors through Thomas Land. The line features , where stationary models are kept, Knapford Station, which serves as the main station and a refreshment stand, Dryaw, and Tidmouth Hault. It also has many sidings and sheds along the way, one of which carries a sleeping model of James.

In early 2009, HIT Entertainment announced that the original models from the television series would be put on display at Thomas Land in an exhibit called "Discover Thomas & Friends", as production was to move to Canada, now that the series is to be animated with CGI. The models were then put on display in 2010. So far, the layout features Great Waterton, a town that first appeared in "The Great Discovery", the Fishing Village and Brendam Docks. Many other buildings have been seen from previous seasons from the show, such as "Neptune's Refreshments", "Ben's Books", Toby's Shed and Bluff's Cove signal box. Models have also appeared in the workshop, including: , Terence, Trevor, Elizabeth, Butch, 3 Horrid Lorries, a canal boat, , , 2 red and white express carriages, 2 green and cream express carriages, Thomas, Edward, Toby
