G-sharp major is a major scale based on the musical note G-sharp, consisting of the pitches G, A, , C, D,  and . Its key signature has six sharps and one .

For clarity and simplicity, G-sharp major is usually notated as its enharmonic equivalent of A-flat major; however, it does appear as a secondary key area in several works in sharp keys - most notably in the Prelude and Fugue in C-sharp major from Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1. The G-sharp minor prelude and fugue from the same set end with a Picardy third in G-sharp major.

G-sharp major is tonicised briefly in several of Frédéric Chopin's  nocturnes in C-sharp minor. A section in the third movement of Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1 is in G-sharp major, although the key signature has 4 sharps. The end of the exposition of the second movement Charles-Valentin Alkan's Grande sonate 'Les quatre âges', subtitled Quasi-Faust, is in G-sharp major, although written with a six-sharp key signature (the movement opens in D-sharp minor and ends in F-sharp major).
