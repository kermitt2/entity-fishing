'The Great White Hope' is a 1970 biographical romantic drama film written and adapted from the Howard Sackler play of the same name.

The film was directed by Martin Ritt, starring James Earl Jones, Jane Alexander, Chester Morris, Hal Holbrook, Beah Richards and Moses Gunn. Jones and Alexander, who also appeared in the same roles in the stage versions, both received Best Actor and Actress  nominations for their performances.

Set between 1910 and 1915, the story follows Jack Jefferson (James Earl Jones; patterned after real-life boxer Jack Johnson) going on a hot streak of victories in the boxing ring as he defeats every white boxer around.
