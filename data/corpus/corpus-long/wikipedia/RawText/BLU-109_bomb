The BLU-109/B is a hardened penetration bomb used by the United States Air Force (BLU is an acronym for Bomb Live Unit). As other "bunker busters", it is intended to smash through concrete shelters and other hardened structures before exploding. In addition to the US, it is part of the armament of the air force of Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.

The BLU-109/B has a steel casing about 1&nbsp;inch (25.4&nbsp;mm) thick, filled with 530&nbsp;lb (240&nbsp;kg) of Tritonal. It has a delayed-action tail-fuze. The BLU-109 entered service in 1985. It is also used as the warhead of some marks of the GBU-15 electro-optically guided bomb, the GBU-27 Paveway III laser-guided bomb, and the AGM-130 rocket-boosted weapon. This weapon supposedly has the same penetration as the Small Diameter Bomb
