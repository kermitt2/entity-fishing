Chippenham United F.C. was an English football club based in Chippenham, Wiltshire. The team played in the Western Football League for twelve seasons after World War II, but left in 1960. They also participated in the FA Cup for fourteen seasons.

Joining the Western League Division Two for the 1948–49 season, United won the division at their first attempt, gaining promotion to Division One. The following season, they finished above their local rivals Chippenham Town for what was to be the only time in the club's history. United's best league finish was in 1950–51, when they finished fourth, with Town in third position. The following seasons were less successful, and they only escaped relegation in 1955–56 due to expansion of Division One. However, the club was relegated in 1957–58 after finishing bottom of the table. The club dropped out of the Western League at the end of the 1959–60 season, and disbanded a couple of years later.

During their first Cup run in 1948–49 they defeated Radstock Town before losing 2–1 at home to Trowbridge Town in the Preliminary Round. The following season they reached the First Qualifying Round, losing 3–0 at Clandown.
