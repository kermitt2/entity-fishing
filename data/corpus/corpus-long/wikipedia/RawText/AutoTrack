AutoTrack is a vehicle swept path analysis software program used for analysing the movements of steered and wheeled vehicles including , , , aircraft and other more specialist vehicles such as  trucks,  and access platforms. AutoTrack was the worlds first swept path analysis software program, originally being jointly developed by TRL (the UK's Transport Research Laboratory) and British engineering consultants, Travers Morgan (acquired by Symonds in 1995 who are now part of Capita Symonds, in the form of TRACK. The term track refers to the tracking of a vehicles simulated movements in relation to geometry, based upon vehicle dimensions, chassis and steering specification.

AutoTrack is generally used by transportation engineers, architects and planners for the analysis and design of , ,  and other facilities to check that provision has been made for the space and geometry required to manouvre specified design . A design vehicle may be a real vehicle modelled within the software's computer environment but will often be a virtual vehicle that does not exist in real life, but rather is indicative of the type and configuration of vehicle that the final design is expected to accommodate. Design vehicles are commonly specified by the relevant governing body that also controls the specification for which the design must conform.

The AutoTrack range is divided into modules that service the Road,  and  industries and operates within several different  systems such as AutoCAD by Autodesk,  by Bentley Systems, Bricscad by Bricsys (a former member of the ) and standalone in Microsoft Windows. When the software was first developed it initially ran as a DOS based application and when it was ported to operate within AutoCAD
